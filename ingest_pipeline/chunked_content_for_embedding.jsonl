Most studies are from Western \ncountries, limiting understanding of LM in the Chinese population. This study \naims to explore LM characteristics in Chinese patients and develop tailored \ntreatment strategies.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively studied 103 Chinese LM patients, all confirmed by \nCSF cytology, from 2015 to 2024. Data on demographics, medical history, imaging, \nand follow-up were gathered. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan - \nMeier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to \nidentify prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed, and patients were \nstratified into risk groups based on these factors.\nRESULTS: The median age was 54.99\u2009\u00b1\u200911.18 years, with 53.4% being female.

CCUS is a blood condition defined by a decrease in blood cells. Blood cells are composed of either red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. In patients with CCUS, blood counts have been low for a long period of time. Patients with CCUS also have a mutation in one of the genes that are responsible for helping blood cells develop. The combination of genetic mutations and low blood cell counts puts patients with CCUS at a higher risk to develop blood cancers in the future.

The hormone receptors were \ncompared and evaluated in relation to p53 and body mass index (BMI) using \nFisher's Exact test.\nRESULTS: In a majority of cases, expression of AR was concordant with ER and/or \nPR.

The recommended diagnostic \nstrategy involves initial screening with tissue-based assays (TBAs), followed by \nconfirmation with cell-based assays (CBAs). While specialized centers use \nin-house TBAs, many clinical laboratories depend on commercial TBAs, whose \naccuracy is yet to be fully assessed.\nMETHODS: We selected 92 CSF and 99 serum samples from patients with autoimmune \nencephalitis and NSAbs confirmed by in-house TBAs and CBAs (20 samples each for \nAMPAR, GABAAR, GABABR, IgLON5, LGI1, NMDAR, and CASPR2; 19 for mGluR5; 17 for \nDPPX; and 15 for mGluR1 antibodies), along with 50 CSF and 50 serum samples from \nnegative controls. We assessed the performance of a commercial indirect \nimmunofluorescence (IIF)-TBA (EUROIMMUN).

This study aims to describe the frequency of \npatients with DCM who reported experiencing symptoms of flu-like illness before \ntheir DCM diagnosis and to examine if this experience modified the association \nbetween genetics and DCM.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from the family-based cross-sectional DCM Study \nconducted between 2016 and 2021. Self-reported symptoms of flu-like illness \nproximal to DCM diagnosis were obtained from patient interviews. Exome \nsequencing identified rare variants (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variant \nof uncertain significance) in DCM genes. In a case-only design, logistic mixed \nmodels were used to examine if flu-like illness modified the effect of these \nrare variants on DCM risk.

This is partly because smoking impairs the function of cilia, tiny hairs lining the airways that sweep out mucus to keep the airways clean.

This study examined the vocal development \ntrajectory in children who received early simultaneous bilateral cochlear \nimplants (CIs) and compared it to age-matched children with typical hearing \n(TH).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case-control study design.\nMETHODS: Participants included nine children who received simultaneous bilateral \nCIs between 7 and 20\u00a0months of age and eight age-matched children with TH. \nParent-child play interactions were video- and audio-recorded at 6-month \nintervals. Child vocalizations were categorized into four categories: \nnoncanonical babbling, canonical babbling, words, and sentences.

It clinically mimics submandibular gland \nneoplasms and has a possible association with IgG4-related disease. The \nliterature on standardised diagnostic and management pathways is limited. This \npaper presents a case series and narrative literature review to support a \nproposed diagnostic and management approach for Kuttner's tumour. Methods: \nTwelve cases of patients with a Kuttner's tumour aged between 55 and 87, \nidentified from 2018 to 2025 through hospital records, were reviewed. All \npatients underwent ultrasound assessment using standardised diagnostic criteria \nand were followed up clinically and radiologically every six months. In \nparallel, we performed a narrative review of studies published between 2005 and \n2025, identifying nine relevant articles to contextualise our findings.

Preoperative radiograph imaging revealed the \npresence of a thoracic kyphosis and scoliosis, with a Cobb angle of 150\u00b0 and \n130\u00b0, respectively.

To address these limitations and knowledge gaps, we developed a \nmultifeature HPV whole-genome sequencing (WGS) liquid biopsy for improved \nlow-level ctHPVDNA detection.

They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during lumbar punctures is recommended but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column manometry is cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure transduction probes that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or recommended for lumbar punctures. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during the LP procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure changes during LPs", "metadata": {"original_doc_id": "NCT01285531", "original_doc_source": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "original_doc_title": "Pediatric Lumbar Puncture Success Using the COMPASS", "original_doc_url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01285531", "original_doc_publication_date": "2011-02-17T00:00:00Z", "original_doc_retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:37:50.533295Z", "chunk_index_in_doc": 1, "nctId": "NCT01285531", "status": "UNKNOWN", "studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "conditions": ["Lumbar Puncture"], "interventions": ["Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced"]}}
