The database was queried for newly \ndiagnosed patients with cancer stages I-IV who had TTI within 0-180 days. \nStepwise linear regression models were used as a variable selection technique to \nidentify the most significant independent variables to evaluate as predictor \nvariables.\nRESULTS: The study sample included 5,615,193 patients (median age, 65; 51.5% \nfemale; 86.1% White) across 30 different cancer types (most prevalent: breast \n[22.1%], lung [18.8%], prostate [16.6%]). The median [IQR] TTI across all 30 \ncancer types was 26 [6-47] days, with an increase of 7 days from 2004 (21 \n[4-44]) to 2015 (28 [9-49]; P < .001). No individual cancer type decreased in \nTTI from 2004 to 2015. The proportion of patients diagnosed with new stage I \ndisease increased by 52.2% from 2004 (28.4%, n = 78,732) to 2015 (43.2%, n = \n256,150). All other stages decreased in percent incidence. There was a 100.0% \nincrease in median TTI for stage I patients from 2004 to 2015 (14-28 days). \nCancer stage was the most important predictor of change in TTI for 16 cancer \ntypes (P < .001 for all 16).\nCONCLUSION: TTI is increasing for patients with cancer, and the recent increase \nin stage I diagnoses is highly associated with this change.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/OP.23.00614\nPMID: 40393016", "authors": ["Dafflisio GJ", "Wang M", "Wang X", "Spratt DE", "Zuhour R", "Khorana AA", "Bilimoria KY", "Zaorsky NG"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393016/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:26:48.323892Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393016", "doi": "10.1200/OP.23.00614", "journal": "JCO oncology practice"}}

However, the mechanisms underlying this evolution \nremain poorly understood. Here, we show that Retinoid X receptor \u03b3 (RXR\u03b3) is \nuniquely overexpressed in chemo-resistant SCLC tumors, and that RXR\u03b3 serves as \nan essential factor driving chemoresistance in SCLC. RXR\u03b3 forms phase-separated \ndroplets with LSD1 in the nucleus, which enhances RXR\u03b3-mediated gene \ntranscription activity and reprograms gene expression, promoting tumor stemness \nand metastasis, and eventually driving SCLC chemoresistance. In turn, RXR\u03b3 \nantagonist disrupts RXR\u03b3-LSD1 interaction, reducing their binding to the target \ngene locus, markedly suppressing the expression of the RXR\u03b3 target gene network. \nFinally, RXR\u03b3 antagonists strongly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and \nrestore SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple preclinical SCLC models, \nresulting in a substantial extension of survival in mouse models. Thus, these \nresults establish RXR\u03b3 as a key player in SCLC by phase separation and as a \npotential therapeutic target for this deadly disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2421199122\nPMID: 40392852\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests statement:The authors \ndeclare no competing interest.", "authors": ["Wang H", "Huang J", "Zhang Z", "An Y", "Sun H", "Chen J", "Feng W", "Duan H", "Mou Y", "Wang Y", "Liu P", "Zhou H", "Chen HW", "Zhang J", "Lu X", "Wang J"], "publication_date": "2025 May 27", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392852/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:26:50.572129Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392852", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2421199122", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}

Because inefficient antigen presenting MHC class I \nexpression (which can be downregulated by HIF-1) is an important strategy for \ncancer immune evasion, besides its anti-angiogenesis effect, it remains unclear \nwhether Endostar has an inhibitory effect on HIF-1 expression by upregulating \nMHC class I expression in cancer cells to facilitate immunotherapies, including \nPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. In this study, A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells were \ntreated with Endostar (6.25\u2009\u03bcg/ml, 12.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml, and 25\u2009\u03bcg/ml, respectively). \nHIF-1 expression was detected by Immunocytochemistry and Western blot. Proteins \nof the MHC class I \u03b1-heavy chain and \u03b22\u2009m light chain, STAT3 and pSTAT3 were \ndetected by Western blot. The mRNAs of MHC class I \u03b1-heavy chain and \u03b22\u2009m light \nchain were detected by RT-qPCR. It was shown that decreased expression of HIF-1 \nand promotion of \u03b22-microglobulin were observed after Endostar treatment. In \naddition, elevated levels of MHC class I \u03b1-heavy chain mRNA and protein, as well \nas downregulation of STAT3 and pSTAT3, were also observed following Endostar \ntreatment. Endostar inhibited HIF-1 expression in A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer \ncells, upregulated expression of MHC class I \u03b1-heavy chain and \u03b22\u2009m light chain, \nwith the upregulation of STAT3 and pSTAT3, suggesting involvement of STAT3 \npathway. It is important because only in combination with MHC class I on target \ncells can tumor antigenic peptides be recognized by CD8+ CTLs which destroy \ntarget cells. However, MHC class I is frequently deficient in cancer cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15384047.2025.2508535\nPMID: 40392714", "authors": ["Zhao MZ", "Zheng HF", "Wang JN", "Zhang YM", "Wang HJ", "Zhao ZW"], "publication_date": "2025 Dec", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392714/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:26:52.850263Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392714", "doi": "10.1080/15384047.2025.2508535", "journal": "Cancer biology & therapy"}}

Electronic address: \nmtopper1@jhmi.edu.\n\nDespite much progress in targeting the MYC oncoprotein, combination treatment \nstrategies are needed to exploit this molecular vulnerability. To this end, we \ninterrogated transcriptome data from cancer cell lines treated with MYC \ninhibitors and identified HDAC5 and HDAC9, both class IIa histone deacetylases \n(HDACs), as potential therapeutic targets. Notably, these therapeutically \nactionable HDAC isoforms are known augmenters of several hallmarks of cancer. \nDual targeting of MYC and class IIa HDACs induces a significant reduction in \nviability for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with high MYC and \nmitochondrial activity. Additionally, combination treatment induces a robust MYC \nsuppression with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, which \nhas a causal relationship with therapeutic efficacy. Confirmation of in vivo \nefficacy was pursued in several animal models, with subsequent \nmolecular-correlate derivation confirming the importance of MYC depletion and \nmitochondrial dysfunction in drug efficacy. Ultimately, we define a therapeutic \napproach combining MYC- and class IIa HDAC-inhibition to potentiate anti-tumor \nefficacy in NSCLC.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

Most studies are from Western \ncountries, limiting understanding of LM in the Chinese population. This study \naims to explore LM characteristics in Chinese patients and develop tailored \ntreatment strategies.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively studied 103 Chinese LM patients, all confirmed by \nCSF cytology, from 2015 to 2024. Data on demographics, medical history, imaging, \nand follow-up were gathered. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan - \nMeier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to \nidentify prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed, and patients were \nstratified into risk groups based on these factors.\nRESULTS: The median age was 54.99\u2009\u00b1\u200911.18 years, with 53.4% being female. Lung \ncancer was the primary tumor in 76.7% of patients. Headache was the most common \nsymptom. The median survival was 441 days. Primary tumor site, CSF tumor cell \nproportion, and asymptomatic status at diagnosis were independent prognostic \nfactors. The nomogram's C - index was 0.81. We identified two distinct groups of \nLM patients with markedly different characteristics, which we designated as the \nindolent and rapid progression phases of LM.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of LM patients with positive CSF \ncytology at the center were described, with a longer median survival than \npreviously reported. The developed nomogram demonstrated potential clinical \npredictive value. Two distinct LM patient groups were identified: the indolent \nand rapid progression phases, which hold significant clinical relevance.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

An update of the thoracoabdominal advancement flap technique has been \nproposed, enabling definition of the inframammary fold and significant skin \nrecruitment. This study aimed to provide information on safety, patient \nmanagement, and validated patient-reported outcomes, enabling a critical \nanalysis of this technique.\nMETHOD: This single-centre retrospective cohort study included female patients, \naged \u226518 years, with history of breast cancer treated by total mastectomy, and \ncomplete delayed breast reconstruction with thoracoabdominal advancement flap. \nThe data collected included age, history of radiotherapy, surgical protocol, \ncomplications, reoperations of the inframammary fold, and BREAST-Q score at the \nend of reconstruction.\nRESULTS: The 100 patients included underwent 102 delayed breast reconstructions. \nReconstructive methods were deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap \n(n=50), muscle sparring latissimus dorsi flap (n=29), transverse myocutaneous \ngracilis flap (n=7), prosthesis (n=4), and adipose tissue transfers (n=12). \nThoracoabdominal advancement flap was associated with 4 Clavien-Dindo Grade I \ncomplication (delayed wound healing); 42 patients underwent surgical revision of \ninframammary fold (IMF) placement. BREAST-Q results at the end of reconstruction \nwere available for 63 patients; the mean\u00b1standard deviation score for \nSatisfaction with breast was 61.9\u00b112.3, and for Physical well-being: chest this \nwas 71.9\u00b120.2.\nCONCLUSION: This IMF reconstructive technique is safe, with minimal \ncomplications, and compatible with all reconstructive methods. It ensures \npatient satisfaction, even in irradiated areas, and respects the aesthetic \nsubunits of the breast, maintaining a single breast scar and providing skin \nsimilar to the thorax. The multistep reconstructive protocol allows for revision \nthat further consolidates cosmetic results.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Among them, cathepsin B (CTSB), a cysteine protease, is \nnotably involved in the development of breast cancer and neuroblastoma. In this \nstudy, we explored the potential of darifenacin as a repurposed therapeutic \ntargeting CTSB, using molecular docking and simulation studies which \ndemonstrated a significantly lower binding energy against CTSB (-456.268 kJ/mol) \ncompared to its known inhibitor, aloxistatin (-36.601 kJ/mol). The cytotoxic \nefficacy of darifenacin was evaluated on IMR-32 (neuroblastoma) and MCF-7 \n(breast cancer) cells, yielding half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of \n38.14 and 39.96 \u00b5M, respectively. Darifenacin effectively inhibited CTSB \nenzymatic activity by ~1.82 and ~1.75-fold in IMR-32 and MCF-7 cells, \nrespectively, triggering intracellular ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane \npotential depolarization, and cell cycle arrest. These events culminated in \napoptosis-mediated cell death, with apoptotic populations reaching 51.39% in \nIMR-32 and 40.6% in MCF-7 cells, respectively. Additionally, darifenacin \ndisrupted lipid droplet accumulation, cellular migration, and colony and \nsphere-forming abilities in both cell lines.

This study \naims to summarize the surgical techniques and perioperative experiences to \nprovide clinical evidence for pediatric OTCT.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical data of 89 children who \nunderwent umbilical single-incision laparoscopic oophorectomy at Children's \nHospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics between September 2020 and December \n2024. The types of primary diseases were summarized, differences in preoperative \ncomplete blood count results, surgery methods and intraoperative conditions were \nexplored among different primary diseases. Different surgical methods were \nreviewed. The surgery steps and techniques were summarized. The trends in \nsurgical volume over time and the surgical learning curve were analyzed. The \nfactors affecting follicle density were also explored.\nRESULTS: The primary diseases in this study included Turner syndrome, aplastic \nanemia, mucopolysaccharidosis in, chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \ninfection, hematological malignancies, solid tumors, platelet dysfuction, \nmetachromatic leukodystrophy, hemophagocytic syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome, \nbeta-thalassemia, osteopetrosis, dermatomyositis, congenital dyserythropoietic \nanemia, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and primary immunodeficiency. Children \nreceived chemotherapy will experience a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) and \nneutrophil levels, necessitating granulocyte-stimulating therapy; children with \naplastic anemia had a significant drop in hemoglobin level, thus requiring red \nblood cell transfusions; children with myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic \nanemia showed a marked decrease in platelet levels, necessitating platelet \ntransfusions. Children with Turner syndrome most commonly have the unclosed \ninternal inguinal ring. The main steps of umbilical single-incision laparoscopic \noophorectomy were incision, trocar placement, observation, suspension, \ndissection, removal, and incision closure. The number of umbilical \nsingle-incision laparoscopic oophorectomy had been increasing year by year. The \nlearning curve analysis indicated that the first 35 cases were the learning and \nimprovement phase. Follicular density was significantly correlated with age, \nprimary disease and ovarian color.\nCONCLUSION: Pediatric OTCT has broad applications and a promising future. \nPerioperative preparation and the surgical process are important. It is \nnecessary to adjust the complete blood cell count to ensure that WBC greater \nthan 4*10^9/L, neutrophils greater than 1*10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than 70 \ng/L, and platelet greater than 100*10^9/L before surgery. Given the small volume \nof children's ovaries, it's necessary to remove the entire ovary.

Normal tissues show weak to negligible \nexpression as it is downregulated. However, its expression is upregulated in \nvarious epithelial and hematological malignancies, including endometrial, \ncervical, and chronic lymphoid leukemia. It plays a vital role in tumor cell \nproliferation, metastasis, and therapy resistance; thus, its expression has been \ndetermined to be a valuable tool in developing targeted therapeutic strategies. \nEndometrial cancers are one of the most common female genital tract malignancies \nwith high mortality. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the BAG-3 protein \nimmunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial cancer and correlated its expression \nwith prognostic determiners.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of BAG-3 \nimmunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial carcinoma. Cytoplasmic and \nmembranous staining was considered positive and its correlations with prognostic \nfactors such as myometrial invasion, LVSI, and ovarian involvement were \nanalyzed.\nRESULTS: BAG-3 immunopositivity was seen in 31 (93.9%) cases and two cases were \nfound to be negative. Twenty-two (66.6%) showed strong (3\u2009+) intensity, seven \n(21.2%) showed moderate, and two (6.1%) showed weak BAG-3 immunostaining. No \nsignificant correlation was seen between grade and intensity.\nCONCLUSION: Inhibiting BAG-3 expression can induce apoptosis, thus promoting a \nnew therapeutic target for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.\n\n\u00a9 Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India 2024.

Ninety-two CRPA BSI cases were randomly \npaired with contemporaneous carbapenem-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CSPA) \nBSI cases at a ratio of 1:1. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was \nperformed to identify risk factors associated with the development of CRPA BSI \nand Cox regression for mortality rates. Survival probability was evaluated using \nthe Kaplan-Meier estimator. Between-group survival differences were analyzed \nusing the Log rank test and Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated to quantify \nmortality risk disparities.\nRESULTS: A total of 361 cancer patients with PA BSI were included, 25.5% \n(92/361) of which were infected with CRPA. Among the 184 enrolled patients (48 \nwith ST, 136 with HM), the independent risk factors for developing CRPA BSI were \nplatelet counts and recent carbapenem use within 90 days in patients with ST. \nPresence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) and exposure to \ncarbapenems within 90 days were the risk factors for developing CRPA BSI in \npatients with HM. The 30-day mortality of CRPA BSI was 37.5% and 35.3% in \npatients with ST and HM, respectively. Additionally, higher Pitt bacteremia \nscore (PBS) was distinctly associated with increased 30-day mortality in cancer \npatients suffering from CRPA BSI (HR 1.672, 95% CI 1.309-2.135, p< 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The mortality rates of CRPA BSI are notably high in both patients \nwith ST and HM.

CAR-NK cell therapy targeting CD7 has \nemerged as a promising approach for treating T-cell malignancies. However, \nconventional CAR-NK cell therapy faces the challenges of cell fratricide due to \nCD7 expression on both malignant cells and normal NK cells. Additionally, \nengineering CARs into human tissue-derived NK cells demonstrates heterogeneity, \nlow transduction efficiency, and high manufacturing costs.\nMETHODS: The human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were genetically modified by \nknocking out the CD7 gene and introducing the CD7 CAR expression cassette to \ngenerate CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-hPSCs. These modified hPSCs were subsequently \ndifferentiated into CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells using an efficient organoid \ninduction method. The cytotoxicity of CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells against CD7+ \ntumor cells was evaluated. Furthermore, we overexpressed the CXCR4 gene in CD7 \nKO-CD7 CAR-hPSCs and derived CXCR4-expressing CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK (CRO-CD7 \nCAR-iNK) cells. The dynamics of CRO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells in vivo were tracked, and \ntheir therapeutic efficacy was assessed using human T-cell acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia (T-ALL) xenograft models.\nRESULTS: The CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells derived from CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-hPSCs \neffectively avoided fratricide, demonstrated normal expansion, and exhibited \npotent and specific anti-tumor activity against CD7+ T-cell tumor cell lines and \nprimary T-ALL cells. CXCR4 overexpression in CRO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells improved \ntheir homing capacity and extended their persistence in vivo. The CRO-CD7 \nCAR-iNK cells significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the survival \nof T-ALL tumor-bearing mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a reliable strategy for the large-scale \ngeneration of fratricide-resistant CD7 CAR-iNK cells with robust anti-tumor \neffects from hPSCs, offering a promising cell product to treat T-cell \nmalignancies.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

DRE has become less routinely performed \nfollowing removal from cancer screening guidelines. The effect of this decreased \nutilization has not been studied; this study sought to evaluate current DRE \nutilization and changes over time.\nMETHODS: The electronic medical record database of a regional academic health \nsystem was assessed between 2015 and 2020 for encounters with patients aged \n45-75. DRE rates and yearly trends were assessed using chi-squared and \nCochran-Armitage tests, respectively.\nRESULTS: Of 191\u2009329 outpatient encounters, DRE was documented on 8.5% of visits. \nDRE utilization declined from 2015 to 2020 (9.6% vs. 8.9%). DRE was more often \nidentified as a procedure in surgical specialties, including surgical oncology \n(55.6%) and general surgery (2.8%), compared to primary care specialties, \nincluding family medicine (1.7%) and internal medicine (1.6%). DREs were less \nfrequently documented for non-Hispanic Black patients versus non-Black patients \n(7.2% vs. 8.4%) and for Hispanic patients versus Non-Hispanic White patients \n(7.6% vs. 8.5%).

The aim of this study was to evaluate \nthe possible relationship between these three conditions.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study between January 2019 and December 2023 was done \nat Jarrio Hospital (Asturias, Spain). We included all patients with a first \ncomplete colonoscopy. Exclusion criteria were: previous colonoscopy or \ncolorectal resection; age under sixteen years old; incomplete colonoscopy or \ninsufficient bowel preparation. Information about age, sex, BMI, location and \nhistology of polyps and location of diverticula and cancer was recorded. \nLogistic regression was carried out to identify the association between \ndiverticulosis with polyps and neoplasms, as well as with other variables.\nRESULTS: A total of 2,328 patients were recruited. Prevalence of diverticular \ndisease, polyps and colorectal cancer was 36.5%, 26.7% and 9.4%. Patients with \npolyps, diverticulosis and cancer were older and had higher BMI. Polyps and \ncancer were more common in men but no differences in prevalence of diverticular \ndisease were found between men and women. Patients with diverticula had a higher \nrisk of having polyps (Odds Ratio=1.3) but did not have an increased risk of \ncolorectal cancer. Diverticula, polyps and cancer were found more frequently in \ndistal colon.\nCONCLUSIONS: A positive association between the presence of diverticula and the \nappearance of polyps in the colon is found in this study.

We draw on theorizations of policy ecologies to \nprovide a framework for better understanding the processes involved in \noperationalizing policy with greater inclusivity in language in health \npromotion. Twenty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 key \ninformants between April and October 2022 to explore the operationalization of \ninclusive language in health promotion in the context of a national program to \npromote cervical screening to currently underscreening communities in Australia. \nFour thematic categories emphasize the balance required between demands and \ndomains: (i) the need for clinical guidelines and flexibility in their \ntranslation and interpretation; (ii) organizational mandates, clinical practice, \nand patient-centred care; (iii) socio-cultural norms, behaviours, and attitudes \namid politicized/ing milieus; and (iv) community preferences and the need for \nmedical accuracy. As such, we identified how the operationalization of inclusive \nlanguage in policy is influenced by and influences other domains where cervical \nscreening is promoted. These findings hold wider implications for how the \nhistorical legacies of and contemporary need for 'women's health' can be \nmaintained and respected amid demands for greater gender inclusion.

Although \nsepsis-induced organ dysfunction is well studied, its role in cancer \nprogression, particularly in UCEC, remains poorly understood.\nPURPOSE: This study investigated the sepsis-related immune signature (SRIS) C3 \nin UCEC to uncover its role in tumor progression and metastasis.\nMETHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data from TCGA and GEO databases were \nanalyzed using R software to identify DESRGs. Survival analysis, GO, KEGG \npathway, and GSEA were performed to elucidate C3's biological functions. PPI \nnetworks, mutational analysis, methylation profiling, and immune infiltration \nanalysis were conducted using various bioinformatics tools. MTT assays, RT-PCR, \nqPCR, and wound healing assays were performed to validate C3's function in \nHEC-1-B.\nRESULTS: Downregulation of C3 expression in UCEC was associated with enhanced \ninflammation, immune evasion, and metastatic potential, showing mechanisms \nobserved in sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Pathway enrichment analysis \nrevealed significant activation of the NF-\u03baB, JAK-STAT, and complement cascades, \ncontributing to a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Mutational analysis showed a \nsignificant contribution to UCEC development. Protein-protein interaction \nanalysis demonstrated a positive correlation with SRISs. These findings \nhighlight the pivotal role of sepsis-related immune pathways, mainly C3, in \ndriving UCEC progression.\nCONCLUSION: Understanding the molecular interplay between sepsis-related immune \nresponses and tumor progression may offer novel therapeutic opportunities. \nSpecifically, targeting C3 may provide a new treatment strategy for UCEC \npatients with a history of sepsis, thereby improving clinical outcomes and \nguiding personalized therapeutic interventions.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In this study, we explored the role of P-cadherin in head and neck \nsquamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and the mechanisms underlying its function.\nMETHODS: We analyzed P-cadherin expression in HNSCC patients using The Cancer \nGenome Atlas (TCGA), The Chungnam National University Hospital (CNUH) cohort and \nGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. For in vitro functional analysis, we \nconducted proliferation, migration, invasion, and western blot assays after \neither suppressing or overexpressing P-cadherin. For in vivo functional \nanalysis, we utilized mouse xenograft models.\nRESULTS: P-cadherin was significantly overexpressed in tumor samples compared to \nnormal samples in the TCGA-HNSCC and CNUH-HNSCC cohorts. P-cadherin knockdown \nresulted in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion compared to control \ncells, while P-cadherin overexpression increased cell proliferation and \nmigration in HNSCC cells. We discovered that c-Met functions as an upstream \nregulator of P-cadherin. Surprisingly, we found that P-cadherin knockdown \nincreased the phosphorylation of c-Met and STAT3. Combining P-cadherin siRNA \nwith the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 or c-Met siRNA resulted in a more effective \nreduction in HNSCC cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo, compared to either \ntreatment alone.\nCONCLUSION: Our study uncovered a previously unknown aspect of \nP-cadherin-mediated c-Met regulation. The enhanced activation of c-Met/STAT3 \nfollowing P-cadherin inhibition could be responsible for the survival of \nresistant tumor cells. Therefore, dual inhibition of P-cadherin and c-Met may be \nan effective approach for treating HNSCC.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Despite its deceptively bland \nhistomorphology, this neoplasm is paradoxically linked to aggressive clinical \nbehavior and elevated mortality rates.\nPURPOSE: To delineate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of \nDEK::AFF2 fusion-associated carcinomas to elucidate their biological drivers and \nrefine therapeutic strategies.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on some cases initially \ndiagnosed as sinonasal papilloma of various types, with or without dysplasia or \nassociated malignant transformation. DEK::AFF2 fusion was confirmed by DEK \nbreak-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Molecular features were \nassessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) to \ndifferential diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were analyzed for recurrence and \ndisease-specific mortality.\nRESULTS: Nine cases with DEK gene rearrangements were identified. The cohort \ncomprised patients aged 51-76 years (median: 59 years), with a male predominance \n(M:F = 7:2). All cases demonstrated nuclear positivity for p40/p63 and AFF2 (30% \n~90% tumor cells), while staining for p16 and Epstein-Barr encoded mRNA (EBER) \nwas uniformly negative by IHC and ISH. Ki-67 index ranges from 5 to 40% with the \nmedian at 20%. Local recurrences occurred in 55.6% (5/9) of patients within \n10-30 months following initial therapeutic intervention. The disease-specific \nmortality observed in 22.2% (2/9) of cases.\nCONCLUSION: DEK::AFF2 fusion-associated carcinoma is characterized by a \nclinicopathological dichotomy: bland histological features contrast with \naggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis in the nasal cavity, paranasal \nsinuses, and skull base.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

With increased research in \nimmunotherapy, antibodies against various immune checkpoints like programmed \ndeath receptor 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have been \nshown to be effective against a wide range of tumors. Nonetheless, survival \nbenefits gained by HNSCC patients remain limited. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 \n(TIM-3), an emerging immune checkpoint molecule, is found to be expressed in \nHNSCC and is involved in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). TIM-3 \nis significant in the initiation and progression of HNSCC by modulating effector \nT cells, innate immune cells, and other components of the immune system. \nInhibiting TIM-3 can restore T cell function and enhance the immune response \nagainst HNSCC, making it a promising immunotherapeutic target for this disease. \nThis article reviews the expression of TIM-3 in HNSCC and its immunomodulatory \nmechanism and briefly introduces the combined application and development \nprospects of TIM-3 as a potential immunotherapeutic target.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We \naimed to evaluate the PD-L1 (CD274) expression using highly sensitive clone \n73\u2009-\u200910 and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis to elucidate the role of PD-L1 \nin HNSCC and thus potentially expand the pool of eligible patients.\nMETHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of 73\u2009-\u200910, CD3, CD4, and CD8 were \nperformed in 94 HNSCC clinical samples along with paired adjacent squamous \nintraepithelial neoplasm (SIN) and normal oral mucosa (NOM) samples. The 73\u2009-\u200910 \npositivity was evaluated using a tumor cell score\u2009\u2265\u20091%, and the results were \nanalyzed against clinicopathological features including CD4+ and CD8+ \ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, ST \nand PD-L1 related pathway analysis was performed in 6 paired HNSCC, SIN and NOM \nsamples.\nRESULTS: The 73\u2009-\u200910 detected-PD-L1 positivity was high in HNSCC (79%) compared \nto SIN (10%) and NOM (3%). 73\u2009-\u200910+ correlated with high CD4+ TILs, as well as \nthe independent prognostic factor of OS, DSS, and PFS of HNSCC (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nST analysis revealed that the upregulated distribution of CD274 correlated with \n73\u2009-\u200910 positivity. Pathway analysis revealed a significant upregulation of \nCD274 and CD4 in HNSCC compared to SIN and NOM, and HIF-1\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 as key \nregulators of PD-L1 expression in HNSCC.\nCONCLUSION: Clone 73\u2009-\u200910 is a relatively suitable candidate for identifying \npatients with PD-L1 expression eligible for ICI therapy.

PCDLBCL-LT \naccounts for 20% of all primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas (CBCL) and 5% of all \nprimary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL). It is more common in the elderly (median age \n75\u2009years). The disease commonly manifests as rapidly-growing red to bluish often \nulcerating, nodular tumors, plaques or violaceous nodules on one or both lower \nextremities. Only 10% to 15% of lesions develop in other areas. A prognosis of \nPCDLBCL-LT is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 40 to 50%. The first-line \ntreatment of PCDLBCL-LT includes immunochemotherapy, most commonly R-CHOP \n(rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, \nprednisone). In the case of a solitary lesion, excision or radiotherapy should \nbe considered. Many patients demonstrate cutaneous relapses (70%) or systemic \ndissemination (50%). Recent studies have reported the use of Bruton's \ntyrosine-kinase (BTK) inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs and \nimmune check-point inhibitors in treating relapsed or refractory patients. The \nstudy summarizes the current view of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment \nof PCDLBCL-LT, including genetic abnormalities and novel targeted drugs.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/10428194.2025.2506503\nPMID: 40393040", "authors": ["Robak E", "Braun M", "Robak T"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393040/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:28:47.991682Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393040", "doi": "10.1080/10428194.2025.2506503", "journal": "Leukemia & lymphoma"}}

However, current \nmethods often struggle to identify the precise areas responsible for these \nabnormalities after model dominance dispersion. To address this, we propose a \nnovel Transfer Learning-based framework that integrates Optimized RegNet Synergy \narchitectures and Attention-Triplet mechanisms-comprising channel attention, \nsqueeze-excitation attention, and soft attention-combined with an advanced \nEnsemble Learning strategy. A significant gap in current research is the lack of \ntechniques for optimal weight allocation in model predictions. Our study fills \nthis gap by introducing the [Formula: see text] Weighted Ensemble (CWE) method, \nwhich is further enhanced into a Multi-Layer [Formula: see text] Weighted \nEnsemble (ML-CWE) to improve model aggregation across multiple layers. \nEvaluation on the HAM1000 dataset demonstrates that our ML-CWE approach achieves \nan impressive accuracy of 94.08%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art \nmethods. To enhance model interpretability, we employ Gradient Class Activation \nMaps (Grad-CAM) to highlight critical regions of interest, improving both \ntransparency and reliability. This work not only boosts accuracy but also \nfacilitates early diagnosis, addressing challenges related to time, \naccessibility, and cost in skin lesion detection, and offering valuable insights \nfor practical applications in dermatology.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Efat.

However, its role in melanoma remains \nunclear. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was used to \nperform pan-cancer analysis using data from the the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) \nand the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Melanoma tissue microarray \n(TMA), clinical patient tissues, and cells were used to explore USP41 expression \nprofiles by immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-qPCR or Western blotting. Small \ninterfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used to knock down USP41 in melanoma cells. Cell \nproliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed using CCK-8, EdU staining, \nwound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected \nby flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. GEPIA revealed that USP41 is highly \nexpressed in most human cancers, including melanoma. USP41 is overexpressed in \nmelanoma tumor tissues and cells. IHC showed that USP41 was positively stained \nin melanoma tissues and was significantly correlated with the TNM stage of \nmelanoma. USP41 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion \nwhile promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR \nin the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results indicate that USP41 may play a \ncarcinogenic role in melanoma partly via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, \nsuggesting that USP41 may be an effective therapeutic target for the treatments \nof cutaneous melanoma.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In this study, \nwe evaluated AR expression among different types of OCs and compared the results \nto estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER & PR).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: AR, ER, and PR expressions were assessed in 62 cases \nwhich were categorized into: low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSCA), high-grade \nserous carcinoma (HGSCA), clear cell carcinoma (CCCA), ovarian endometrioid \ncarcinoma (OECA), and granulosa cell tumor (GCT). The hormone receptors were \ncompared and evaluated in relation to p53 and body mass index (BMI) using \nFisher's Exact test.\nRESULTS: In a majority of cases, expression of AR was concordant with ER and/or \nPR. Positivity for all three receptors was observed in 100% of OECAs. AR \nexpression was seen in 92% of HGSCAs as opposed to 88% and 44% for ER and PR. \nLGSCAs had expressed AR and ER (100%), and PR (70%). In GCTs, positivity rates \nwere 92%, 62%, and 92% for AR, ER, and PR. In rare cases of HGSCA and CCCA, AR \nwas positive despite negative ER and PR.\nCONCLUSION: AR is expressed in a high percentage of OCs, even more frequently \nthan ER and PR in certain high-grade histological types. Overall, our findings \nare similar to the results of recent studies of AR expression in endometrial \ncancers. These findings support an important possible role for AR in OCs as a \npotential marker to serve as a therapeutic target in these malignancies.\n\nCopyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be \nfreely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise \nused by anyone for any lawful purpose.

While homologous recombination \n(HR)-deficiency is a well-established predictor of therapy sensitivity, over 50% \nof HR-proficient HGSC also exhibit sensitivity. Currently, there are no \nbiomarkers to identify which HR-proficient HGSCs will be sensitive to \nstandard-of-care therapy. Replication stress may serve as a key determinant of \nresponse.\nMETHODS: We evaluated phospho-RPA2-T21 (pRPA2) foci via immunofluorescence as a \nbiomarker of replication stress in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HGSC \nsamples collected at diagnosis from patients treated with platinum chemotherapy \n(discovery cohort: n=31, validation cohort: n=244) or PARP inhibitors (n=63). \nRecurrent HGSCs (n=38) were also analyzed. pRPA2 score was calculated using \nautomated imaging analysis.\nRESULTS: Samples were defined as pRPA2-High if >16% of cells had \u22652 pRPA2 foci \non automated analysis. In the discovery cohort, HR-proficient, pRPA2-High HGSCs \ndemonstrated significantly higher rates of a chemotherapy response score of 3 to \nplatinum chemotherapy than HR-proficient, pRPA2-Low HGSCs. In the validation \ncohort, patients with HR-proficient, pRPA2-High HGSCs had significantly longer \nsurvival after platinum treatment than those with HR-proficient, pRPA2-Low \nHGSCs. Additionally, the pRPA2 assay effectively predicted survival outcomes in \npatients treated with PARP inhibitors and in recurrent HGSC samples.\nCONCLUSION: Our study underscores the importance of considering replication \nstress marker, such as pRPA2, alongside HR status in therapeutic planning.

The proportional meta-analysis produced oncological and \nsurgical outcome rates comparable to or lower than conventional nipple-sparing \nmastectomy rates. However, longer operative time (weighted mean difference = \n43.08\u2005min; P < 0.00001) and duration of hospital stay (weighted mean difference \n= 0.72 days; P = 0.0007) were observed.\nCONCLUSION: Endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy does not affect oncological \noutcomes in up to 52 months mean follow-up when compared with conventional \nnipple-sparing mastectomy and provides better cosmetic satisfaction, with a \nreduced risk of necrosis after single-incision endoscopic nipple-sparing \nmastectomy. As such, endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy may become a viable \nbreast surgery option.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Dysregulation of apoptosis is considered as\u00a0one of the most \nimportant factors for malignant transformation. DEK is a ubiquitous protein, and \nits downregulation induces apoptosis by altering BCL-2, BAX, and CASPASE-3 \nexpressions. This study illuminates the cumulative clinical usefulness of DEK \nand related apoptotic proteins.\nMETHODS: A total of 119 patients were enrolled during 2021-2023. Demographic and \nclinicopathological data were recorded at presentation, and the follow-up was \ndone till August 2024. Tissue samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry \nand real-time PCR. A paired t test assessed gene expression between normal and \nmalignant tissues of different treatment strategies. The crosstab was performed \nto find the association of DEK, BCL-2, BAX, and CASPASE-3 with \nclinicopathological features. Pearson's correlation was used to predict the \nassociation of DEK with other apoptotic factors. Survival and hazard risk were \nevaluated using log-rank and Cox regression.\nRESULTS: The mean age of OC patients was 47.61\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\u00a0years, presented with \nadvanced stage (90.7%) and grade (85.3%). Most of them were post-menopausal \n(68.08%) and had unhygienic (76.5%) regular menstrual cycles (89.1%), and also \nexperienced early pregnancy (61.8%). Some of these factors are related to a \nhazard risk (HR\u2009>\u20091). DEK and apoptotic proteins were upregulated in OC than in \nnormal (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). DEK was positively correlated with BCL-2, BAX, and CASPASE-3, \nat both mRNA and protein levels, and only BAX showed significance in both \n(p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). All the selected genes are independent risk factors for survival of \nOC (HR\u2009>\u20091), but only DEK and CASPASE-3 were significantly associated with poor \nsurvival (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Dysregulation of DEK, CASPASE-3, and BAX/BCL-2 is associated with \npoor overall survival. Further, this study highlights the correlation between \nDEK and key apoptotic regulators, emphasizing the critical role of DEK in OC \nprognosis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aims to summarize \nthe incidences of adverse events (AEs) in patients with solid tumors receiving \nICB in adjuvant setting, and evaluate the effect of ICB addition on incidences \nof these adverse events.\nMETHODS: We searched public databases and relevant international conference \nproceedings up to 20 September 2024, to identify eligible randomized controlled \ntrials evaluating the ICB-based treatments in adjuvant setting for patients with \nsolid tumors. The primary outcomes included treatment-related death, \ntreatment-related adverse events (TrAEs), immune-related adverse events (IrAEs), \nserious AEs, and discontinuation due to AEs. The GRADE approach was used to \nevaluate the certainty of evidence for primary outcomes.\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight trials with 25\u00a0852 participants were included. Single-arm \nmeta-analysis showed that combination therapies had higher grade 3-4 TrAEs than \nPD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, while anti-CTLA-4-based therapies exhibited greater \ndiscontinuation rates (49.7% [39.4-60.0] for anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy) versus \nother ICB strategies. Treatment-related death was rare, occurring in 63 of \n16\u00a0272 participants receiving adjuvant ICB-based treatments. The pairwise \nmeta-analysis revealed that the addition of ICB was associated with increased \ntreatment-related deaths (OR [95% CI]: 1.713 [1.117-2.628]), although this \nassociation was observed only in the CTLA-4 blockade and not in the PD-1 or \nPD-L1 blockade. ICB addition also increased incidences of TrAEs, IrAEs, serious \nAEs, and discontinuations, with consistent results across blockade types. \nAdditionally, ICB addition was associated with higher incidences of 37 types of \nAEs, including 20 grade 3-4 events. Most results had moderate evidence quality.\nCONCLUSION: Adding ICB in adjuvant setting was associated with increased AEs, \nbut the toxicity profile was largely similar to that in the advanced setting.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Patients were included if they had symptomatic vaginal \nmasses other than prolapse and underwent treatment for the same. Data were \nanalysed by statistical software Stata 14.0. Descriptive statistics were \ncomputed to summarize the frequency of demographic and clinical variables. \nQuantitative variable expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (standard deviation) and median \n(minimum-maximum). Categorical variable expressed as frequency and percentage.\nRESULTS: The median age of the patients included in the analysis was 39.5\u00a0years \nold. A total of 15 patients underwent surgical management, which included \nvaginal excision or marsupialization, and 5 were conservatively managed. \nPresenting symptoms included feeling of a mass or bulge in 12 (60%) of patients, \nurinary complaint (n\u2009=\u20097; 35%) and dyspareunia (n\u2009=\u20091; 5%). Preoperative imaging \nstudies were obtained in 19 patients; ultrasound was used in 95%, magnetic \nresonance imaging in 25%, computed tomographic scanning in 15% and multiple \nmodalities in 20%. No patients were found to have other genitourinary anomalies. \nThe average cyst size was 4.5\u00a0cm (range, 3-15\u00a0cm). Surgical excision was done in \n15 cases except for 1 case of marsupialization. Histopathological examination \nshowed that 2 solid masses had leiomyoma, seven patients had Gartner duct cyst \nand six patients reported Bartholin cyst. The median follow-up was 12\u00a0months \n(range, 3-21\u00a0months). During the follow-up period, one patient had persistent \nstress urinary incontinence (SUI), and the other one had persistent urinary \nurgency incontinence (UUI). Remaining patients were freed from preoperative \npresenting symptomatology. Neither had recurrence of the mass nor any \ncomplications were observed during the follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Vaginal masses are rare and often asymptomatic, but may present with \nvaried clinical symptoms. They can be managed conservatively and surgically with \ngood outcome.

Challenges in overcoming physical barriers \nhowever greatly limit CAR-T cell efficacy in solid tumours. Here we show that an \napproach based on collagenase nanogel generally improves the outcome of T \ncell-based therapies, and specifically of CAR-T cell therapy. The nanogels are \ncreated by cross-linking collagenase and subsequently modifying them with a \nCXCR4 antagonist peptide. These nanogels can bind CAR-T cells via \nreceptor-ligand interaction, resulting in cellular backpack delivery systems. \nThe nanogel backpacks modulate tumoural infiltration and localization of CAR-T \ncells by surmounting physical barriers and disrupting chemokine-mediated CAR-T \ncell imprisonment, thereby addressing their navigation deficiency within solid \ntumours.

These data and the known ability of the \nTLR4-activated MyD88-NF\u03baB pathway to mobilize both antitumor and tumor-promoting \nevents in the TME provide new tools to enhance the efficacy of \nchemo-immunotherapy for metastatic, and potentially early, TNBC and other \ntaxane-sensitive cancers.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

However, recent studies showed that chronic \nCD27-CD70 interaction in cancer can lead to apoptosis of T cells, rendering them \ndysfunctional. CD70 is expressed not only by hematological tumors but also by \nsolid tumor cells. This expression is regulated by hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), \nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CD27 \nexpression on intratumoral T cells identifies exhausted and dysfunctional T \ncells, as well as regulatory T cells with enhanced immunosuppressive activity. \nGiven the preferential expression of CD70 on certain tumor cells, several \ntherapeutic approaches including antibody-drug conjugate, anti-CD70 CAR T cells, \nand anti-CD70 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), have been investigated in various \npreclinical models and clinical trials. To date, the most significant clinical \nresults are observed in hematological malignancies. However, no therapeutic \ntools specifically targeting the deleterious CD27-CD70 interaction have been \ndeveloped. Most CD70-targeting mAb also deplete other CD70-expressing cells, \nsuch as activated T cells. Interestingly, chronic CD27-CD70 interaction results \nin the release of detectable soluble CD27 in patient plasma. The presence of \nhigh levels of soluble CD27 in plasma correlates with resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 \nin renal cancer, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Conversely, the \nabsence of a predictive impact soluble CD27 in melanoma patients treated with \nthe more toxic combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 may justify therapeutic \nescalation with this regimen. Thus, the CD27-CD70 axis may serve as both a \npotential biomarker to guide the choice of immunotherapy and a novel clinical \ntarget.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-2668\nPMID: 40388162", "authors": ["Sam I", "Ben Hamouda N", "Alkatrib M", "Gonnin C", "Siska PJ", "Oudard S", "Lebb\u00e9 C", "Tartour E"], "publication_date": "2025 May 19", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40388162/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:29:39.895781Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40388162", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-2668", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"}}

Many clinical laboratories use \ncommercially available TBAs as a screening test, but their diagnostic yield has \nnot been assessed. We determined the performance of 2 commercial TBAs in \ndetecting IC-Abs.\nMETHODS: We analyzed samples from 100 patients with autoimmune or paraneoplastic \nneurologic syndromes harboring IC-Abs (confirmed by in-house TBAs and line blots \nor CBAs) and 50 negative controls. IC-Abs samples included serum (10 each for \nHu, Yo, Ri, SOX1, CV2, Ma2, Tr, amphiphysin, and GAD65 antibodies) or CSF (10 \nwith GFAP antibodies) samples. Two commercial indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) \nTBAs (INOVA and EUROIMMUN) were assessed by 2 experienced investigators and 3 \nless experienced raters, all blinded to antibody status. Discordant results were \nre-evaluated through interrater discussion and assessed using Cohen's kappa.\nRESULTS: The 2 experienced raters showed substantial agreement (85% for INOVA, \n83% for EUROIMMUN) on negative/positive results, which increased to >95% after \ninterrater discussion (Cohen's kappa 0.95 and 0.93, respectively). With \nIIF-INOVA, they correctly identified 118 of 150 samples (79%) and misclassified \n28 of 150 (19%, 2 false positives and 26 false negatives) while results remained \ndiscordant in the remaining 4 of 150 samples (2%). With IIF-EUROIMMUN, they \ncorrectly identified 105 of 150 samples (70%) and misclassified 40 of 150 (27%, \n6 false positives, 34 false negatives), with discordance in 5 of 150 samples \n(3%). Overall, the sensitivity was 73% for IIF-INOVA and 66% for IIF-EUROIMMUN. \nThe specificity was 96% for IIF-INOVA and 88% for IIF-EUROIMMUN. Both TBAs \nshowed low sensitivity in detecting CV2, SOX1, and amphiphysin antibodies while \nMa2 antibodies were missed mainly by IIF-EUROIMMUN and Hu/Ri antibodies by \nIIF-INOVA. Antibody-specific immunostaining patterns were correctly identified \nin 62 of 100 positive samples with IIF-INOVA and 55 of 100 with IIF-EUROIMMUN (p \n= 0.34). Less experienced raters showed higher rates of false-positive results \n(up to 22% with IIF-EUROIMMUN).\nDISCUSSION: The performance of commercial IIF-TBAs for IC-Abs detection is \nsuboptimal, exhibiting high false-negative rates of 25%-35%. Therefore, \ncommercial TBAs should not be used alone for IC-Abs screening, but alongside \nmore sensitive techniques, such as line blots. Discordant results between 2 \ntechniques should prompt retesting in reference centers with in-house TBAs, \nparticularly when the suspicion of an autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome is \nhigh.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/NXI.0000000000200410\nPMID: 40393022", "authors": ["Milano C", "Businaro P", "Papi C", "Arlettaz L", "Marmolejo L", "Naranjo L", "Gastaldi M", "Iorio R", "Saiz A", "Planagum\u00e0 J", "Aguilar E", "Pizzanelli C", "Martinez-Hernandez E", "Armangu\u00e9 T", "Guasp M", "Ruiz-Garc\u00eda R", "Sabater L", "Dalmau JO", "Graus F", "Spatola M"], "publication_date": "2025 Jul", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393022/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:29:49.443278Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393022", "doi": "10.1212/NXI.0000000000200410", "journal": "Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation"}}

The recommended diagnostic \nstrategy involves initial screening with tissue-based assays (TBAs), followed by \nconfirmation with cell-based assays (CBAs). While specialized centers use \nin-house TBAs, many clinical laboratories depend on commercial TBAs, whose \naccuracy is yet to be fully assessed.\nMETHODS: We selected 92 CSF and 99 serum samples from patients with autoimmune \nencephalitis and NSAbs confirmed by in-house TBAs and CBAs (20 samples each for \nAMPAR, GABAAR, GABABR, IgLON5, LGI1, NMDAR, and CASPR2; 19 for mGluR5; 17 for \nDPPX; and 15 for mGluR1 antibodies), along with 50 CSF and 50 serum samples from \nnegative controls. We assessed the performance of a commercial indirect \nimmunofluorescence (IIF)-TBA (EUROIMMUN). Slides were evaluated as \"positive\" or \n\"negative\" by 2 experienced investigators and 2 less experienced raters. \nDiscordant results were re-evaluated through interrater discussion and assessed \nusing Cohen's kappa.\nRESULTS: The experienced raters agreed on 94% (133/142) of CSF and 88% (131/149) \nof serum classifications (Cohen's kappa = 0.87 and 0.75, respectively, p < \n0.001). Among CSF samples, 75% (106/142) were correctly identified while 19% \n(27/142) were misclassified (13 false positives, 14 false negatives). Among \nserum samples, 66% (98/149) were correctly identified while 22% (33/149) were \nmisclassified (11 false positives, 22 false negatives). The poorest performance \nwas seen in detecting NMDAR, GABAAR, and mGluR5 Abs, which were not identified \nin 5 of 10, 6 of 10, and 5 of 9 serum samples and in 4 of 10, 5 of 10, and 5 of \n10 CSF samples, respectively. The overall sensitivity of the commercial IIF-TBA \nwas 84% for CSF and 76% for serum while the specificity was 72% for CSF and 73% \nfor serum. Less experienced raters correctly identified 69% (98/142) of CSF \nsamples and 73% (109/149) of serum samples and misclassified 13% (18/142) of CSF \nsamples and 11% (16/149) of serum samples, and 18% (26/142) of CSF samples and \n16% (24/149) of serum samples remained discordant.\nDISCUSSION: The diagnostic performance of EUROIMMUN IIF-TBA in detecting NSAbs \nin autoimmune encephalitis is suboptimal. NMDAR antibodies, among the most \ncommon NSAbs, can be missed in 50% of cases. This commercial TBA should not be \nused alone as a screening method nor as a confirmatory technique for NSAbs.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/NXI.0000000000200406\nPMID: 40393020", "authors": ["Papi C", "Milano C", "Arlettaz L", "Businaro P", "Marmolejo L", "Naranjo L", "Planagum\u00e0 J", "Martinez-Hernandez E", "Armangu\u00e9 T", "Guasp M", "Ruiz-Garc\u00eda R", "Aguilar E", "Gastaldi M", "Iorio R", "Gaig C", "Saiz A", "Sabater L", "Graus F", "Dalmau JO", "Spatola M"], "publication_date": "2025 Jul", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393020/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:29:51.792232Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393020", "doi": "10.1212/NXI.0000000000200406", "journal": "Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation"}}

While interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) modulates the GC response via IL-1R1 \nand IL-1R2 receptors on follicular T cells in animal models, its role in humans \nremains unclear. We analyzed Tfh and Tfr phenotypes in human secondary lymphoid \norgans (tonsils, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes) using flow cytometry, \nsingle-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro culture, comparing findings with \nsamples from autoimmune patients. We observed organ-specific Tfh/Tfr phenotypes \naccording to activation status and IL-1 receptor expression. An excess of IL-1R1 \nover IL-1R2 expression promoted a unique activated Tfr subset with Treg and \nGC-Tfh features. IL-1\u03b2 signaling via IL-1R1 enhanced follicular T-cell \nactivation and Tfh-to-Tfr differentiation, while IL-1\u03b2 inhibition upregulated \nIL-1R1, indicating a tightly regulated process. In autoimmune patients, high \nIL-1\u03b2 and circulating Tfr levels correlated with increased autoantibody \nproduction, linking inflammation, IL-1\u03b2 signaling, and Tfr/Tfh balance. Our \nfindings highlight the critical role of IL-1\u03b2 in follicular T-cell activation \nand suggest that targeting IL-1\u03b2 signaling in Tfh and Tfr cells could be a \npromising strategy for treating antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.188724\nPMID: 40392614", "authors": ["Vaineau R", "Jeger-Madiot R", "Ali-Moussa S", "Prudhomme L", "Debarnot H", "Coatnoan N", "Dubois J", "Binvignat M", "Vantomme H", "Gouritin B", "Fourcade G", "Engeroff P", "Belb\u00e9zier A", "Luscan R", "Denoyelle F", "Lorenzon R", "Ribet C", "Rosenzwajg M", "Bellier B", "Klatzmann D", "Tchitchek N", "Graff-Dubois S"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392614/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:29:54.256301Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392614", "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.188724", "journal": "JCI insight"}}

This case underscores the potential for \nexogenous triggers such as vaccination to induce SLE, highlighting the need for \nvigilance in managing autoimmune responses, particularly in patients with \nchronic conditions such as ADPKD. Despite the patient's history of ADPKD, no \nprevious reports have linked this condition to post-vaccine SLE. Concurrent \nnephrotic syndrome in patients with ADPKD is rare, and the possibility of other \ntreatable glomerular diseases should be considered when this is seen.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Circumcision \nis the primary treatment for phimosis in pediatric LS, and corticosteroids are \nconsidered the best choice for medical management. Recently, Ozoile, stable \nozonides obtained through green technology from extravirgin olive oil (+\u2009OIL\u00ae), \naccording to a patented process, has emerged as a potential alternative with \nfewer long-term side effects compared to corticosteroids. The aim of the study \nwas to compare the immune and anti-proliferative effects of the pre-operative \ntopical use of Ozoile and corticosteroids in children with phimosis associated \nwith LS undergoing circumcision.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six male patients aged 3-9\u00a0years with phimosis linked to LS were \ndivided into three groups: Group A (no pre-operative treatment), Group B (0.1% \nmometasone furoate), Group C (Ozoile). Post-circumcision foreskin samples were \nanalyzed for immune cell infiltration (CD8\u2009+, CD57\u2009+) and proliferation markers \n(Ki67,p53). Non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) and Dunn tests were used \nand p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Histological analysis showed acanthotic epidermis and lymphoid \ninfiltrate in Group A, with reduced lymphocytes and markers in Groups B and C. \nGroups B and C showed no significant differences in CD8\u2009+\u2009and CD57\u2009+\u2009lymphocytes \n(p\u2009=\u20090.34, p\u2009=\u20090.54, respectively), but Group C had significantly lower \nproliferation markers Ki-67 (p\u2009=\u20090.035) and p53 (p\u2009=\u20090.039).\nCONCLUSION: Both Ozoile and corticosteroids reduced inflammatory and \nproliferative activity in pediatric LS patients. Ozoile showed superior \nsuppression of proliferative markers, suggesting potential benefits for patients \nat risk of steroid-related side effects.

This heart problem is referred to as congenital heart block (the most serious being third degree complete block) and represents damage thought to be caused by these autoantibodies. The heart beats abnormally slowly and almost all children require permanent pacemakers before the age of 20. Importantly, women who have had one child with heart block have a ten-fold higher risk of having another child with the same heart condition. Unfortunately, even close monitoring by special techniques during pregnancy does not reverse complete heart block once it is observed. Thus, treatments aimed at prevention are critical. This study will evaluate for the first time whether hydroxychloroquine, a drug used by many patients with SLE, prevents the development of this heart condition. Data from laboratory experiments suggests that this drug, which crosses the placenta, may decrease the inflammation initiated by the passage of anti-Ro antibodies to the fetus. The study uses a Simon's 2-Stage design, and plans to enroll 19 patients in Stage 1 and 35 patients in Stage 2 if Stage 1 is successful. Patients can already be on hydroxychloroquine or will be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. The hope is that fewer than 3 cases of heart block will occur in Stage 1, and fewer than 6 cases will occur out of all 54 patients if Stage 2 is reached. The results of this study are expected to become an integral part of the counseling of women with anti-Ro/La antibodies who are considering pregnancy.", "authors": ["NYU Langone Health"], "publication_date": "2021-02-25T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01379573", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:30:04.156132Z", "metadata": {"nctId": "NCT01379573", "status": "COMPLETED", "studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "conditions": ["Congenital Heart Block", "Neonatal Lupus", "Autoantibody-Associated Heart Block"], "interventions": ["Hydroxychloroquine"]}}

Patients were \nclassified into three groups: 1) long COVID defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 \ntest and a long COVID-related diagnosis code (n\u2009=\u2009580); 2) recovered COVID \ndefined by a positive test and no long COVID associated diagnosis codes \n(n\u2009=\u20097,437); and 3) non-COVID PAIS defined by a negative test, non-SARS-CoV-2 \nrelated PAIS diagnosis codes, and no COVID related codes (n\u2009=\u2009106). Using \nmultivariate logistic regression, we compared the clinical characteristics of \nthese groups at three timeframes to address preclinical, acute and post-acute \ndiagnoses: before index SARS-CoV-2 test, within 30 days of index test, and\u2009>\u200930 \ndays after index test.\nRESULTS: The long COVID group had a higher Charlson comorbidity index [median \n(IQR), 2 (0-4)] than the other two patient groups [median (IQR), 1 (0-3) and 1 \n(0-3)]. The long COVID and non-COVID PAIS patients were older and had greater \nsmoking exposure than the recovered COVID group. Compared to the recovered COVID \ncontrol group, the long COVID group had more health problems prior to the \ninfection, including respiratory and metabolic as well as more severe infections \nand comorbidities based on the ICD codes found in the acute phase records. In \nthe post-acute timeframe, many symptoms were more likely to be associated with \nlong COVID than recovered patients with COVID-19 including abnormalities of \nheart beat [OR (95% CI), 5.31 (3.96-7.13)], cognition, perception, or emotional \nstate symptoms [OR (95% CI), 5.14 (3.81-6.92)], malaise and fatigue [OR (95% \nCI), 4.20 (3.13-5.63)], and sleep disorders [OR (95% CI), 2.47, (1.79-3.43)], \nall p\u2009<\u20090.05. In contrast, the non-COVID PAIS group shared many similarities \nwith the long COVID group across all three timeframes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with long COVID were more similar to patients \nwith a non-COVID-related PAIS than to recovered patients with COVID-19.

Increasingly, multiple data sources are available \nto describe individual and population mobility in a single location; however, \nthere are no methods to systematically integrate these data. Combining \ninformation from these data sets may be valuable and help mitigate inherent \nbiases in each data set due to sampling, censoring, and recall. We examined four \ncommonly used data sources (mobile phone records, travel survey, Demographic and \nHealth Survey, and Facebook location information) to quantify subnational travel \npatterns in Zambia. First, we explored summary metrics of mobility from each \ndata set. Estimates of the probability of a trip and location of travel varied \nacross data sets, with some data quantifying twice the frequency of travel as \nothers. Then, we developed a departure-diffusion model that is able to produce a \nsingle estimate of travel by combining these data sets. When multi-data set \nmodels included mobile phone records, this data source dominated estimates given \nthe broader spatial coverage. We then used a metapopulation model to simulate a \nmeasles outbreak to identify how these different data sets and models would \nimpact estimates of the spatial spread of a highly infectious disease. We found \nthat using travel survey data to parameterize mobility resulted in the \nintroduction of cases in 98% of districts compared to less than 50% when mobile \nphone data or Facebook data were used. This study highlights the need for \nmethods that facilitate integrating multiple data sets to improve validity of \nmobility estimates and resultant infectious disease transmission dynamics.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Kostandova et al.

Its \nprevalence was estimated to 4.33/million in 2020 in Italy. Whether growing \ndisease awareness and improved diagnostics may have increased national diagnoses \nin the last 4 years is unresolved.\nMETHODS: All alive ATTRv diagnoses from 2004 to 2024 from 16 Italian referral \ncenters were retrospectively assessed and included in the analysis.\nRESULTS: As of March 2024, 373 ATTRv patients were in active follow up, with an \noverall national prevalence increased from 2020 previous survey up to \n6.33/million. The most prevalent mutations were Ile68Leu (25.1%), Phe64Leu \n(21.9%), Val30Met (19.3%), Glu89Gln (10.7%), and Val122Ile (6.7%). Ile68Leu, \nVal122Ile, and Val30Met were more common in Northern and Central Italy, while \nGlu89Gln and Phe64Leu were prevalent in Southern Italy. Cardiovascular phenotype \nwas the most common (35.6%), followed by neuropathic (33.2%) and mixed \nphenotypes (31.2%). Referral to disease-specific therapy mirrored the change in \nepidemiology.\nCONCLUSION: ATTRv prevalence in Italy has increased by 50% in a 4 years' time \nframe, with a shift towards milder disease stages and more mixed phenotypes. \nThese changes may reflect improved disease awareness, enhanced genetic \nscreening, and comprehensive care in specialized centers.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Intranasal insulin (INI) has emerged as a potential \ntreatment for T2DM-related cognitive decline. We aimed to evaluate the effect of \nINI treatment on rsFC with medio-prefrontal (mPFC) and left/right hippocampus \n(lHPC/rHPC), and their relationship with the cognition, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), \nand homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and walking \nspeed. An MRI sub-study of the MemAID trial was conducted, involving a 24-week \ntreatment with either intranasal insulin or placebo. Blood oxygen \nlevel-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) images were acquired on eighteen DM \nsubjects at baseline and eleven DM subjects (eight DM-INI patients and three \nDM-Placebo) at the end-of-treatment. Compared to DM-Placebo treated subjects, \nDM-INI patients showed increased mPFC-postcentral rsFC, lHPC-frontal rsFC, \nlHPC-postcentral rsFC, rHPC-frontal rsFC, and lHPC-mPFC rsFC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The \ndecreased HOMA-IR, which was observed in the MemAID trial, was associated with \nincreased mPFC-basal ganglia rsFC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This sub-study provides insights \ninto potential mechanisms of INI effects on rsFC that require validation in a \nlarger trial.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Zhang et al.

This study aims to describe the frequency of \npatients with DCM who reported experiencing symptoms of flu-like illness before \ntheir DCM diagnosis and to examine if this experience modified the association \nbetween genetics and DCM.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from the family-based cross-sectional DCM Study \nconducted between 2016 and 2021. Self-reported symptoms of flu-like illness \nproximal to DCM diagnosis were obtained from patient interviews. Exome \nsequencing identified rare variants (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variant \nof uncertain significance) in DCM genes. In a case-only design, logistic mixed \nmodels were used to examine if flu-like illness modified the effect of these \nrare variants on DCM risk. Firth logistic regression was used to examine if \nflu-like illness modified the effect of each of 13\u2005400\u2005141 common autosomal \nvariants (minor allele frequency \u22651%) on DCM risk.\nRESULTS: Of 1164 patients with DCM, 30.2% reported symptoms of flu-like illness \nproximal to DCM diagnosis. The percentage of patients with antecedent flu-like \nillness by variant classification was 30.0% for pathogenic/likely pathogenic, \n29.6% for variant of uncertain significance only, and 30.0% for no \npathogenic/likely pathogenic/variant of uncertain significance. Antecedent \nflu-like illness was not found to modify the effect of carrying any pathogenic, \nlikely pathogenic, or variant of uncertain significance variants on DCM risk \n(interaction relative risk, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.7-1.3]). However, significant \nmodification of the effect of rs2102158 (3q24) by antecedent flu-like illness \n(P=2.74\u00d710-8) was identified by case-only genome-wide association study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with DCM experienced flu-like \nillness symptoms before DCM diagnosis. We did not find evidence that a flu-like \nillness modified the effect of rare variants on DCM risk; however, our \ngenome-wide association study analysis suggested that flu-like illness may \nmodify the effect of a common variant on DCM risk.\nREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: \nNCT03037632.\n\nDOI: 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.124.012602\nPMID: 40392911\n\nConflict of interest statement: None.", "authors": ["Ni H", "Cao J", "Kinnamon DD", "Jordan E", "Haas GJ", "Hofmeyer M", "Kransdorf EP", "Diamond J", "Owens A", "Lowes B", "Stoller D", "Tang WHW", "Drazner MH", "Shah P", "Wilcox JE", "Katz SD", "Jimenez J", "Shore S", "Judge DP", "Mead JO", "Cowan J", "Parker PK", "Huggins GS", "Hershberger RE"], "publication_date": "2025 May", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392911/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:30:39.004209Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392911", "doi": "10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.124.012602", "journal": "Circulation.

However, the associations of short-term exposure to \ntemperature variability, a crucial aspect of climate change, with myocardial \ninfarction (MI) hospital admissions remains unclear.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This population-based nationwide study employed a \ntime-stratified, case-crossover design to investigate the association between \nambient temperature variability and MI hospital admissions among 233,617 \npatients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry in Sweden between 2005 and 2019. \nHigh-resolution (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091 km) daily mean ambient temperature was assigned to \npatients' residential areas. Temperature variability was calculated as the \ndifference between the same-day (as the MI event) ambient temperature and the \naverage temperature over the preceding 7 days. An upward temperature shift \nrepresents a rise in the current day's temperature relative to the 7-day \naverage, while a downward temperature shift indicates a corresponding decrease. \nA conditional logistic regression model with distributed lag non-linear model \nwas applied to estimate the association between ambient temperature variability \nand total MI (encompassing all MI types), ST-segment elevation myocardial \ninfarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) \nhospital admissions at lag 0-6 days. Potential effect modifiers, such as sex, \nhistory of diseases, and season, were also examined. The patients had an average \nage of 70.6 years, and 34.5% of them were female. Our study found that an upward \ntemperature shift was associated with increased risks of total MI (encompassing \nall MI types), STEMI, and NSTEMI hospital admissions at lag 0 day, with odds \nratios (OR, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 1.009 (1.005, 1.013; p\u2009<\u20090.001), \n1.014 (1.006, 1.022; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and 1.007 (1.001, 1.012; p\u2009=\u20090.014) per 1 \u00b0C \nincrease, respectively. These associations attenuated and became non-significant \nover lags 1-6 days. Furthermore, a downward temperature shift was associated \nwith increased risks of hospital admissions for total MI (encompassing all MI \ntypes) at a lag of 2 days with an OR (95% CI): 1.003 (1.001, 1.005; p\u2009=\u20090.014), \nand for STEMI at lags 2 and 3 days with ORs (95% CI): 1.006 (1.002, 1.010; \np\u2009=\u20090.001) and 1.005 (1.001, 1.008; p\u2009=\u20090.011), per 1 \u00b0C decrease, respectively. \nConversely, higher downward temperature shifts were associated with decreased \nrisks of total MI (encompassing all MI types) and NSTEMI at lag 0 day. No \nsignificant associations were observed at other lag days for downward \ntemperature shifts. Males and patients with diabetes had higher MI \nhospitalization risks from upward temperature shift exposure, while downward \ntemperature shift exposure in cold seasons posed greater MI hospitalization \nrisks. A methodological limitation was the use of ambient temperature \nvariability as a proxy for personal exposure, which, while practical for \nlarge-scale studies, may not precisely reflect individual temperature exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study contributes insights that short-term \nexposures to higher temperature variability-greater upward or downward \ntemperature shifts-are associated with an increased risk of MI hospitalization. \nOur finding highlights the cardiovascular health threats posed by higher \ntemperature variability, which are anticipated to increase in frequency and \nintensity due to climate change.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Ni et al.

Evidence is steadily growing for the relation between dietary quality (and potential nutritional deficiencies) and mental health, and for the select use of nutrient-based supplements to address deficiencies, or as monotherapies or augmentation therapies. There is currently strong advocacy for the recognition of diet and nutrition as central determinants of both physical and mental health.Its anti-inflammatory and haematocrit boosting properties have been well documented though the precise mechanism of action is still largely unknown.

Finally, we found that axon length-dependent presynapse loss in \nfly models of human NDDs utilized this pathway, requiring upd3 and glial \nexpression of the phagocytic receptor draper.

In almost all instances \nof ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies, stathmin-2 encoding mRNAs are \ncryptically spliced and polyadenylated in motor neurons, a pathogenic \nconsequence of nuclear loss of function of the RNA binding protein TDP-43. While \nstathmin-2 has been shown to enhance regeneration after axonal injury to axons \nof cultured motor neurons, here, we show that after crush injury within the \nadult murine nervous system of wild-type or stathmin-2-null mice, the presence \nof stathmin-2 reduces axonal and neuromuscular junction degeneration and \nstimulates reinnervation and functional recovery.

After identifying research hot spots, \nthe study also followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines for a \nscoping review of deep learning models for FOG from 5 databases: Web of Science, \nPubMed, IEEE Xplore, Embase, and Google Scholar.\nRESULTS: A total of 750 studies were included in the bibliometric analysis, and \n40 studies were included in the scoping review. The analysis revealed a growing \nnumber of related publications, with 3700 researchers contributing. Neurology \nhad the highest average annual participation rate (12.46/19, 66%). The United \nStates contributed the most research (192/1171, 16.4%), with 210 participating \ninstitutions, which was the highest among all countries. In the study of deep \nlearning models for FOG, the average accuracy of the models was 0.92, \nsensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.90, and area under the curve was 0.91. \nIn addition, 31 (78%) studies indicated that the best models were primarily \nconvolutional neural networks or convolutional neural networks-based \narchitectures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Research on digital biomarkers for PD is currently at a stable \nstage of development, with widespread global interest from countries, \ninstitutions, and researchers. However, challenges remain, including \ninsufficient interdisciplinary and interinstitutional collaboration, as well as \na lack of corporate funding for related projects. Current research trends \nprimarily focus on motor-related studies, particularly FOG monitoring. However, \ndeep learning models for FOG still lack external validation and standardized \nperformance reporting. Future research will likely progress toward deeper \napplications of artificial intelligence, enhanced interinstitutional \ncollaboration, comprehensive analysis of different data types, and the \nexploration of digital biomarkers for a broader range of Parkinson symptoms.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Open Science Foundation (OSF Registries) OSF.IO/RG8Y3; \nhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RG8Y3.\n\n\u00a9Wenhao Qi, Shiying Shen, Chaoqun dong, Mengjiao Zhao, Shuaiqi Zang, Xiaohong \nZhu, Jiaqi Li, Bin Wang, Yankai Shi, Yongze Dong, Huajuan Shen, Junling Kang, \nXiaodong Lu, Guowei Jiang, Jingsong Du, Eryi Shu, Qingbo Zhou, Jinghua Wang, \nShihua Cao.

While historically overshadowed by excitatory pyramidal cells in \nspatial coding research, recent advances have demonstrated that inhibitory INs \nnot only coordinate network dynamics but also contribute directly to spatial \ninformation processing. This review aims to provide a novel integrative \nperspective on how distinct IN subtypes participate in spatial coding and how \ntheir dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurological disorders \nsuch as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and \ncerebral hypoxia-ischemia. We synthesize recent findings demonstrating that \ndifferent IN classes-including parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SST)-, \ncholecystokinin (CCK)-, and calretinin (CR)-expressing neurons-exhibit spatially \nselective activity, challenging traditional views of spatial representation, and \ninfluence memory consolidation through network-level interactions. By leveraging \ncutting-edge techniques such as in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics, new \nevidence suggests that INs encode spatial information with a level of \nspecificity previously attributed only to pyramidal cells. Furthermore, we \ninvestigate the impact of inhibitory circuit dysfunction in neurological \ndisorders, examining how disruptions in interneuronal activity lead to impaired \ntheta-gamma coupling, altered sharp wave ripples, and destabilized place cell \nrepresentations, ultimately resulting in spatial memory deficits. This review \nadvances the field by shifting the focus from pyramidal-centered models to a \nmore nuanced understanding of the hippocampal network, emphasizing the active \nrole of INs in spatial coding. By highlighting the translational potential of \ntargeting inhibitory circuits for therapeutic interventions, we propose novel \nstrategies for restoring hippocampal network function in neurological \nconditions. Readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the emerging role \nof INs in spatial representation and the critical implications of their \ndysfunction, paving the way for future research on interneuron-targeted \ntreatments for cognitive disorders.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This underdiagnosed disease, especially in developing \nsettings, may be potentially responsible for the impairment of the quality of \nlife of patients and can even be life-threatening. We report on two patients \nwith this condition in Benin, in whom the diagnosis had not previously been \nmade, despite a long history of upper and lower respiratory symptoms. The \npatients were admitted with complications, a superinfection of bronchiectasis \ncomplicated by pneumonia and purulent pleurisy in a 30-year-old male and by a \nrefractory hypoxemia, acute pulmonary heart disease in another 32-year-old male. \nTreatment outcome was favourable in the first case, but less satisfactory in the \nsecond one.\n\nPublisher: CONTEXTE: Le syndrome de Kartagener est une maladie g\u00e9n\u00e9tique \nautosomique r\u00e9cessive rare, appartenant au large groupe des dyskin\u00e9sies \nciliaires primitives, et incluant le situs inversus.

During and after this outbreak, it has been confirmed once \nagain that finding a drug to prevent and end such diseases as soon as possible \nis an important issue. However, drug discovery and to determine a molecule's \nphysical characteristics in a lab takes effort and time and is a costly process. \nRelevant information about molecules can be obtained by calculating topological \nindices, which are molecular descriptive numerical values corresponding to the \nphysical properties of the chemical structure of a molecule. In this paper, we \nconsider recently used drugs such as arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxy-chloroquine, \nlopinavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, thalidomide and theaflavin in treatment of \nCOVID-19. This article examines neighborhood eccentricity-based topological \ndescriptors that are used to analyze the structures of potential drugs against \nCOVID-19. Eccentricity-based topological indices are advancing the field of \nchem-informatics and helping scientists better understand structure-activity \ncorrelations across a wide range of chemical compounds. The purpose is to \nidentify structural components that have a significant impact on \nphysico-chemical properties. In this context, the chemical structure and the \ncorresponding molecular graph of the drugs under consideration are given in \norder to calculate the neighborhood eccentricity values. QSPR models are studied \nusing linear and cubic regression analysis with topological indices for boiling \npoint, enthalpy of vaporization, flash point, molar refraction, polar surface \narea, polarizability, molar volume and molecular weight properties of these \ndrugs. Regression analysis is applied to find potential correlation between \ndifferent drug characteristics such as bio-availability and efficacy. The \nresults show that topological indices and applied regression models are useful \nin predicting significant characteristics of drugs used for the treatment of \nCOVID-19. Additionally, a comparison of the known values and the calculated \nvalues from the regression models discussed is obtained.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Kara et al.

REG3E was recently identified in canine pancreas and blood, but \nconcentrations in dogs with various diseases are unknown.\nOBJECTIVES: To measure and compare REG3E concentrations in dogs with sepsis, \nacute pancreatitis, gastrointestinal diseases, and healthy dogs.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional study measuring plasma REG3E concentrations using an \nin-house developed ELISA in stored convenience samples from client-owned dogs \nwith naturally occurring sepsis (n\u2009=\u200944), acute pancreatitis (n\u2009=\u200942), acute \n(n\u2009=\u200925) and chronic gastrointestinal diseases (n\u2009=\u200923), and healthy controls \n(n\u2009=\u200980).

The \nunderlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have been \nimplicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential \nnegative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link \nbetween CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 \nknockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and \ninvestigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating \na Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited \nreduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic \ninfiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation \nof inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, \nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and \ninterleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and \nupregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish \nexhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal \nmicrobiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. \nLastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal \ninflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal \nrole of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer \nsubstantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model \nfor investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.\n\n\u00a9 2024, Qin et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7554/eLife.101932\nPMID: 40392591 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: LQ, CH, QZ, YW, DF, AL, LX, YC, JS No competing \ninterests declared", "authors": ["Qin L", "Hu C", "Zhao Q", "Wang Y", "Fan D", "Lin A", "Xiang L", "Chen Y", "Shao J"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392591/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:31:38.704402Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392591", "doi": "10.7554/eLife.101932", "journal": "eLife"}}

Clinical features of mastocytosis are \nbased in large part on dysregulated mast cell mediator release. Affected \nindividuals may present with isolated skin involvement or multisystemic disease \nwith a spectrum of symptoms including anaphylaxis, pathologic fractures, and \nchronic gastrointestinal, neurocognitive, musculoskeletal, and constitutional \nsymptoms. The term \"mastocytosis in the skin\" refers to individuals with \ncutaneous infiltration and encompasses both localized and systemic forms of \ndisease. Cutaneous involvement is further categorized into cutaneous \nmastocytoma, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, and maculopapular cutaneous \nmastocytosis based on morphology. In ~95% of patients with systemic \nmastocytosis, the disease is driven by the KIT D816V somatic variant. The aim of \nthis clinical review is to highlight the diagnostic considerations, management \ncomplexities, and evolving treatment landscape that must be considered when \nevaluating a patient presenting with mastocytosis in their skin. Clinical \nmanifestations, histopathology, and laboratory parameters are essential to \ndiagnosis and determining the disease burden in those with known or suspected \nsystemic mastocytosis. Once appropriately staged, both skin-directed therapy as \nwell as novel systemic treatment options, including selective tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors, can be considered with the potential to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In this study, \nmucosal microbiomes of healthy leopard coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus), \nwhich is of economic importance worldwide, were systematically analyzed and \ncompared by using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The analysis of alpha-diversity \nand beta-diversity revealed significant differences in the structure and \ncomposition of the microbial community between different mucosal layers of P. \nleopardus. The skin microbiota showed the lowest microbial diversity among the \nthree tissues, and the highest interindividual variability within gill groups \nwas observed. Proteobacteria is the dominant phylum of the gut, skin, and gill \nmicrobiomes. Microbial biomarkers of the three mucosal tissues were identified, \nwith the genera Parvibaculum, Aminobacter, Sphingobium, and Ralstonia for skin; \nMesoflavibacter, Winogradskyella, Malaciobacter, Nautella, and Marinobacterium \nfor gills; and Cetobacterium, Photobacterium, and Vibrio for gut. These genera \nwere also the core microorganisms in each tissue. A large number of identical \npathways of the three mucosal surfaces microbiome (e.g., pathways related to \nmetabolism, human diseases, genetic/environmental information processing) and \nsome specifically enriched pathways in each tissue were identified. \nCo-occurrence network analysis revealed that there were more ecological \ncommunities and higher functional diversity in the gill microbiota, and the \ninteractions between gut microbiota are closer and more stable. Our study \nprovides a new perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the mucosal \nmicrobiota of P. leopardus, contributing to an in-depth exploration of the \ninteraction between fish and microorganisms, and may help to predict potential \ndisease outbreaks, thus promoting the development of the fish farming industry.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

MMWR Surveill Summ. 2025 May 22;74(3):1-12. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.ss7403a1.\n\nEnteric Disease Outbreaks Associated with Animal Contact - Animal Contact \nOutbreak Surveillance System, United States, 2009-2021.\n\nEisenstein T, Wong M, Vahey G, Toepfer AP, Gleason B, Benedict K.\n\nPROBLEM/CONDITION: An estimated 450,000 enteric illnesses, 5,000 \nhospitalizations, and 76 deaths associated with animal contact occur each year \nin the United States. Enteric illnesses are diseases that affect the stomach or \nintestines and cause symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, and are \ntypically transmitted from animals to humans through the fecal-oral route. \nHumans might encounter animal feces or bodily fluids through contact with the \nanimal itself, the animal's environment, or the animal's food or water. Although \noutbreak-associated illnesses account for a small subset of all enteric \nillnesses linked to animal contact, data obtained from outbreak surveillance \noffer insights into the underlying epidemiologic factors contributing to \nillnesses, including the pathogens, animals, pathogen-animal category pairs, and \nsettings of outbreaks associated with animal contact.\nPERIOD COVERED: 2009-2021.\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Animal Contact Outbreak Surveillance System (ACOSS) \nwas launched in 2009 in conjunction with the National Outbreak Reporting System \n(NORS), a web-based platform that includes reports of foodborne and waterborne \noutbreaks as well as enteric disease outbreaks transmitted by contact with \nenvironmental sources, infected persons or animals, or unknown modes. ACOSS \nencompasses animal contact outbreaks that are reported to CDC through NORS. \nLocal, state, and territorial health departments voluntarily report animal \ncontact outbreaks, which are defined as two or more enteric illnesses associated \nwith a common animal source. Outbreaks can involve single or multiple states; \nCDC staff typically report multistate outbreaks on behalf of state and \nterritorial health departments. ACOSS defines an animal source as an animal \n(including domestic and wild animals); an animal's feces or bodily fluids \n(except milk and other fluids consumed as food, which are defined as foodborne \nsources); an animal's fur, hair, feathers, scales, or skin; an animal's food; or \nan animal's environment, which includes places in which it lives and roams.\nRESULTS: During 2009-2021, a total of 557 animal contact outbreaks of enteric \ndisease were reported in the United States through ACOSS, accounting for 14,377 \nillnesses, 2,656 hospitalizations, and 22 deaths. Exposures were reported in all \n50 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. During the period there were 393 \nsingle-state outbreaks and 164 multistate outbreaks. Although multistate \noutbreaks comprised 29% of all outbreaks reported through ACOSS, they accounted \nfor 80% of illnesses, 88% of hospitalizations, and 82% of deaths. Among 474 \noutbreaks with a confirmed single etiology, Salmonella was the most common cause \nof outbreaks (248 outbreaks [52%]); these outbreaks accounted for the most \noutbreak-associated illnesses (11,822 [85%]), hospitalizations (2,393 [91%]), \nand deaths (17 [77%]). Cryptosporidium (108 outbreaks [23%]) was the second \nleading cause of confirmed, single etiology outbreaks, followed by Escherichia \ncoli (63 [13%]) and Campylobacter (52 [11%]). The most common exposure locations \namong outbreaks with a single location reported were private home (168 [40%]) \nand farm or dairy (89 [21%]). Among 467 outbreaks for which an animal source \ncould be attributed to a single animal category, ruminants (171 [37%]) were the \nmost implicated animal category (with 75% of ruminant outbreaks attributed to \ncattle), followed by poultry (155 [33%]) and turtles (39 [12%]). Poultry were \nassociated with the most outbreak-associated illnesses (9,095 [66% of illnesses \nresulting from outbreaks attributed to a single animal category]), \nhospitalizations (1,804 [70%]), and deaths (15 [83%]). Most outbreaks (130 [84% \nof all poultry outbreaks]) attributed to poultry had private home reported as at \nleast one of the exposure locations (i.e., backyard poultry) and were \nresponsible for nearly all poultry-associated illnesses (8,897 [98%]). The most \ncommon confirmed pathogen-animal pair was Salmonella and poultry (132 \noutbreaks), followed by Cryptosporidium and ruminants (88), and Salmonella and \nturtles (37). Salmonella and poultry accounted for the highest number of \noutbreak-associated illnesses (8,965), hospitalizations (1,790), and deaths \n(15).\nINTERPRETATION: Animal contact outbreaks of enteric disease reported through \nACOSS provide insights into the animals and etiologies causing \noutbreak-associated enteric illnesses as well as other outbreak characteristics, \nsuch as settings in which outbreaks occur. These findings can guide public \nhealth actions, developed in collaboration with specific populations (e.g., \nbackyard poultry owners) and including interventions tailored to settings, such \nas private homes and farms or dairies, that are more commonly associated with \nanimal contact outbreaks. The high proportion of outbreaks occurring in private \nhomes identifies a potential gap in proper hygiene and enteric disease \nprevention knowledge among animal owners, including owners of backyard poultry, \nwhich might be considered by owners to be pets rather than livestock. Settings \nand populations linked to ruminants, poultry, and turtles (particularly cattle, \nbackyard poultry, and small turtles, respectively) are important targets for \npublic health interventions because of the high number of outbreaks and \noutbreak-associated illnesses associated with these animal sources. Furthermore, \nthe disproportionate impact of multistate outbreaks reiterates the importance of \na collaborative national response but also might reflect limited resources to \ninvestigate or report animal contact outbreaks at state and local levels.\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Public health partners should continue to report animal \ncontact outbreaks through ACOSS to inform evidence-based interventions tailored \nto specific animals, pathogens, populations, and settings. Strengthening the \ncapacity of local, state, and territorial health departments to investigate and \nreport animal contact outbreaks is critical to improving surveillance of animal \ncontact outbreaks. Close collaboration between state, local, and Federal public \nhealth and agricultural partners nationwide is also key in investigating and \nresponding to multistate outbreaks. An integrated One Health approach that \nleverages the expertise of animal, environmental, and public health partners can \nfacilitate successful public health interventions aimed at preventing animal \ncontact outbreaks.\n\nDOI: 10.15585/mmwr.ss7403a1\nPMID: 40392712\n\nConflict of interest statement: All authors have completed and submitted the \nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of \npotential conflicts of interest.

However, an adequate sample size and arandomized, \nmechanistic study is needed to determine acute effects of vGRF biofeedback on \nbiomechanical outcomes. The purpose of the study is to determine differences in \ndiscrete gait biomechanical variables (i.e., first and second peak vGRF, \nmidstance vGRF, peak knee flexion angle (KFA), KFA range-of-motion (ROM), peak \nknee extension moment (KEM), and peak knee abduction moment (KAM) following a \ntreadmill walking protocol between limbs and across four separate conditions in \nindividuals 6-12 months post-ACLR. We utilized a randomized, cross-over \nmechanistic trial where participants walked for 3000 steps for three visual \nfeedback conditions (i.e., HIGH, LOW, and SYMMETRICAL vGRF loading) and a \ncontrol condition on a dual-belt treadmill. We constructed a mixed effects \nlinear model to determine within-subject biomechanical changes between limbs and \nconditions. The HIGH condition elicited greater first peak vGRF, sagittal plane \nmotion (i.e., peak KFA, KFA ROM), and peak KEM compared to the control condition \n(p\u2009<\u20090.01). The LOW condition observed first peak vGRF and KFA ROM decreases but \nincreased peak KFA and KEM (p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to the control condition. No \nnotable biomechanical changes were observed between the SYMMETRICAL and control \nconditions. The HIGH condition produced acute, sagittal plane kinematic and \nkinetic profile improvements in ACLR individuals. vGRF is a viable target for \nmodifying gait biomechanics; future work should determine the long-term health \neffects of vGRF-driven feedback treatment to improve gait profiles post-ACLR.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Orthopaedic Research Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jor.26101\nPMID: 40392535", "authors": ["Bjornsen E", "Evans-Pickett A", "Davis-Wilson H", "Munsch AE", "Blackburn JT", "Franz JR", "Schwartz TA", "Spang J", "Pietrosimone B"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392535/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:31:57.139037Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392535", "doi": "10.1002/jor.26101", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society"}}

A total of 97 eyes of 81 patients \nwith UG/OHT-SU were identified. In addition to demographic and etiological data, \npatients were analysed for the presence of synechiae, peak intraocular pressure \n(IOP) and peak anterior chamber reaction, need for glaucoma and cataract surgery \nduring follow-up.\nRESULTS: The most prominent etiologies associated with UG/OHT-SU were viral \nuveitis, followed by Fuchs' uveitis, Beh\u00e7et's disease and pars planitis. \nElevated peak IOP measurements were found to be correlated with the development \nof glaucoma in patients with uveitis (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The findings indicated that an \nincreased peak anterior chamber reaction was a risk factor for the necessity of \nglaucoma surgery (OR\u2009=\u20094.04; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.43-6.71; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The formation of \nsynechiae was associated with increased peak anterior chamber reactions \n(p\u2009=\u20090.004), resulting in a higher incidence of surgical intervention for \nglaucoma (OR\u2009=\u20095.51; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.00-15.20; p\u2009=\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: UG/OHT-SU is a specific condition that affects a notable proportion \nof uveitis patients in Turkey, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. In \npatients with uveitis, elevated peak IOP, pronounced anterior chamber reaction \nand synechia formation are crucial factors in the progression to glaucoma and \nthe escalating necessity for surgical intervention. Early and effective control \nof inflammation is needed to prevent progression to refractory glaucoma and \nvision loss in these patients.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/09273948.2025.2506805\nPMID: 40393014", "authors": ["Asfuro\u011flu M", "Zeki Fikret C", "K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 M", "Nal\u00e7ac\u0131o\u011flu P"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393014/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:32:15.980634Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393014", "doi": "10.1080/09273948.2025.2506805", "journal": "Ocular immunology and inflammation"}}

Traditional treatment methods often \nface limitations in efficacy and delivery. Vascular retinopathy is a common and \npotentially blinding group of eye diseases with core pathologic mechanisms \ninvolving vascular injury, ischemia, exudation, and neovascularization. Clinical \nmanagement relies heavily on etiologic control (eg, diabetes, hypertension), \nanti-VEGF therapy, laser therapy, and surgical intervention. Recent advancements \nin nanotechnology have led to the development of innovative nanoparticle drug \ncarriers, which offer promising solutions for targeted and sustained drug \ndelivery in the retinal environment. This review explores the application of \nboth conventional and novel nanoparticle carriers in treating VR. We discuss \nvarious types of nanoparticles, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, \nand metal-based carriers, highlighting their unique properties, mechanisms of \naction, and therapeutic benefits. Finally, we provide insights into future \nperspectives for nanoparticle-based therapies in retinal disorders, emphasizing \nthe potential for improved patient outcomes and the need for further research to \noptimize these advanced drug delivery systems.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Lu et al.\n\nDOI: 10.2147/OPTH.S503273\nPMCID: PMC12087915\nPMID: 40391093\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interest in \nthis work.", "authors": ["Lu H", "He N", "Zhang L", "You Y", "Lv Z"], "publication_date": "2025-01-01", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40391093/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:32:23.645824Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40391093", "doi": "10.2147/OPTH.S503273", "journal": "Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)"}}

In this \nreport, we present the case of a 33-year-old Hispanic male patient with \nchildhood-onset nyctalopia and progressive visual loss. Fundus examination \nrevealed optic disc pallor and cupping, vascular attenuation, chorioretinal \natrophy, and mid-peripheral bony spicules. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) \ndemonstrated severely reduced scotopic and photopic responses, with \nnon-discernible a- and b-waves and significantly diminished 30 Hz flicker \namplitudes with delayed peak times. Humphrey visual field testing showed \nbilateral peripheral field constriction. A clinical diagnosis of retinitis \npigmentosa was made. Genetic testing via next-generation sequencing revealed a \nhemizygous pathogenic mutation in CACNA1F, specifically c.5037_5038del \n(p.Leu1681Alafs*16), leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. While this \nvariant has been reported in genetic databases, detailed phenotypic descriptions \nremain scarce. Our findings are most consistent with cone-rod dystrophy, \nalthough visual field defects also overlap with features of AIED.

We show that cardiomyocytes express Alk from late embryonic stages \nto adulthood, while jeb expression in pericardial cells coincided with AlkTango \nactivity. Perturbation of cardiac Alk signaling leads to decreased adult \nsurvival as well as lower fitness and increased lethality in response to heat \nstress.

Despite the \navailability of various hypoglycemic agents for clinical use, these agents often \nfail to meet the therapeutic needs of T2DM and its complications. Consequently, \nthere is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies and drugs. Lithocarpus \nlitseifolius(L. litseifolius), commonly referred to as &quot;cordyceps on \ntrees&quot;, has a long history of use in traditional medicine and can be \napplied in tea, sugar, and medicine. Research indicates that L. litseifolius \nextracts are rich in dihydrochalcones, including trilobatin, phloridzin, and \nphloretin, which exhibit a range of pharmacological activities, such as \nanti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective, \nand cardioprotective effects.

Chronic NSAID consumption increases \nthe risk of acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and \ngastrointestinal toxicity, ranging from mild dyspepsia to serious ulcer \ncomplications such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. Proton pump \ninhibitors (PPIs) may exert a gastroprotective effect from NSAID gastroduodenal \ninjury by reducing gastric acid secretion.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of proton pump inhibitors on the prevention of \ndyspepsia and ulcers in people with chronic consumption of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and two \ntrial registers up to 23 October 2023, as well as reference checking, citation \nsearching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and \ncluster-RCTs comparing PPIs taken orally versus placebo, histamine 2-receptor \nantagonists, misoprostol, or sucralfate in adults and children with chronic \nconsumption of NSAIDs for four weeks or longer.\nOUTCOMES: Our outcomes were global symptoms of dyspepsia, incident ulcer, \nadverse events, ulcer complications, and quality of life.\nRISK OF BIAS: We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the tool extension \nfor cluster-RCTs.\nSYNTHESIS METHODS: We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to \ncalculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous \noutcomes and mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Due to \nstatistical heterogeneity, we conducted meta-analyses for all but two outcomes. \nWe summarised the certainty of evidence according to GRADE methods.\nINCLUDED STUDIES: We included 12 studies with 8760 participants. All studies \nwere conducted in an outpatient setting in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, \nCentral America, South America, and Australia. They were published between 1996 \nand 2014. All studies measured outcomes in the short term (up to 12 months).\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: PPI versus placebo PPIs may have little to no effect on \nglobal symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a dichotomous outcome, but the evidence \nis very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained \nstatistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.36 to 1.13; 8 \nstudies; 4944 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result \nin a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a continuous \noutcome (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.38; 2 studies, 1149 participants; \nmoderate-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a reduction in incident \nulcers compared to placebo (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; 11 studies, 7022 \nparticipants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs may have few or no adverse \nevents, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due \nto high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR \nranged from 0.67 to 6.35; 12 studies, 7530 participants; very low-certainty \nevidence). PPIs may reduce ulcer complications compared with placebo (RR 0.33, \n95% CI 0.10 to 1.07; P = 0.30; I2 = 18%; 5 studies, 4394 participants; \nlow-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight increase in quality of \nlife (MD 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; 2 studies, 1149 participants; \nmoderate-certainty evidence). PPI versus histamine 2-receptor antagonists PPIs \nmay increase incident ulcers (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 19.44; 1 study, 26 \nparticipants; low-certainty evidence). The included study did not report data on \nglobal symptoms of dyspepsia, adverse events, ulcer complications, or quality of \nlife. PPI versus misoprostol PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.32, 95% CI \n1.25 to 4.30; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may \nhave fewer adverse events (RR 0.38, 0.25 to 0.57; 1 study, 402 participants; \nvery low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The included \nstudy did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, ulcer complications, \nor quality of life. No studies compared PPI against sucralfate. Most included \nstudies were at overall high risk of bias or overall some concerns of risk of \nbias. Imprecision in the effect estimates was also a concern.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, PPIs may have no effect on the \npresence of global symptoms of dyspepsia and probably result in a slight \nreduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia scales. PPI probably reduces incident \nulcers and may have little to no effect on adverse events. PPIs may reduce ulcer \ncomplications and probably slightly increase quality of life. Compared with \nhistamine 2-receptor antagonists, PPIs may increase incident ulcers. The \nevidence for this comparison came from only one study. Compared with \nmisoprostol, PPIs may increase incident ulcers and may reduce adverse events, \nbut the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence for this comparison came from \nonly one study. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes and comparisons \nwas low or very low, except for global symptoms of dyspepsia measured as a \ncontinuous outcome, incident ulcer, and quality of life in the comparison of PPI \nversus placebo. Further research is needed to assess the effect of PPIs compared \nto other active treatments such as sucralfate, misoprostol, or histamine \n2-receptor antagonists. Well-designed and reported studies focussing on \npatient-important outcomes and addressing the methodological limitations found \nin the present included studies would be informative. These could include \ndifferent baseline ulcer risks, ages, and types of NSAIDs. Long-term follow-up \nwould be beneficial.\nFUNDING: This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.\nREGISTRATION: Protocol (2022): doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014585.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We conducted a multicenter, prospective study \ninvolving 1000 children aged 1 to 18\u00a0years across five centers in China. \nRadiographs were independently assessed for TW3-RUS and TW3-Carpal bone age by \nfive physicians-three juniors and two seniors-both without and with AI \nassistance. An additional AI group was included, relying solely on the AI \nanalyzer. With AI assistance, the mean absolute error for TW3-RUS ranged from \n0.34 to 0.49 for different raters, while for TW3-Carpal, it ranged from 0.32 to \n0.46. The mean squared error was between 0.20 and 0.40 for TW3-RUS and between \n0.18 and 0.36 for TW3-Carpal. The accuracy varied from 88.20 to 96.80% for \nTW3-RUS and from 90.60 to 97.20% for TW3-Carpal. Intraclass correlation \ncoefficients exceeded 0.98 for both TW3-RUS and TW3-Carpal. For both the TW3-RUS \nand TW3-Carpal methods, junior raters exhibited statistically reduced error and \nincreased accuracy with AI assistance (all P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The assistance of AI was \nalso found to significantly benefit senior raters in specific age groups. \nEvaluation time was also significantly reduced with AI assistance (all \nP\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nCONCLUSION: Incorporating AI into BAA enhances accuracy and consistency, \nespecially for junior raters, while reducing evaluation time. Senior raters also \nbenefit in specific age groups.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 Bone age assessment (BAA) is crucial for diagnosing and \nmonitoring endocrine and growth disorders in children, traditionally relying on \nmanual interpretation of radiographs, which is time-consuming and subject to \nvariability.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 The incorporation of an AI-powered X-ray bone age analyzer \nsignificantly enhances the accuracy and consistency of BAA in Chinese children \nand adolescents, particularly benefiting junior raters while reducing evaluation \ntime.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Given that skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in systemic metabolism, \nwe investigated how maternal prepregnancy high-fat diet (HFD) influences muscle \nfibre composition and metabolic function in offspring.\nMETHODS: We established mouse models with a prepregnancy chow diet (CD) and a \nprepregnancy high-fat diet (HFD) for 8\u2009weeks to compare metabolic phenotypes in \noffspring. Skeletal muscles from offspring were analysed using RNA sequencing, \nquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot to \nunderstand the changes in metabolic and signalling pathways. siRNA knockdown and \nlentiviral-mediated overexpression experiments were conducted in\u00a0vitro and \nin\u00a0vivo to validate molecular mechanisms. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed \nby qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) was used to assess histone modification levels at promoter \nregions.\nRESULTS: Male and female offspring of prepregnancy obese dams (mHFD) exhibited a \nsignificant reduction in slow-twitch oxidative fibres (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and an \nincrease in fast-twitch glycolytic fibres compared with controls. This was \naccompanied by impaired glucose tolerance (AUC increased by 12.87%, p\u2009<\u20090.01), \ninsulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction (mtDNA copy number reduced by \n31%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). RNA sequencing identified IDH2 as the most significantly \ndownregulated gene (29.67% decrease, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with protein levels further \nreduced in male (30.15%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and female (46.02%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) offspring. \nIDH2 knockdown in C2C12 cells impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and led to \nhigher oxidative stress (NADP+/NADPH ratio elevated by 32%, p\u2009<\u20090.01), while \nIDH2 overexpression restored mitochondrial integrity, enhanced slow-twitch fibre \nproportion (26.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6936% in mHFD-LV-IDH2, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and improved glucose \nmetabolism (fasting glucose reduced by 14.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). ChIP-qPCR revealed \nincreased H3K9me3 enrichment at the IDH2 promoter (2.54-fold in males, 2.55-fold \nin females, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), suggesting transgenerational epigenetic regulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity induces a metabolic shift in \noffspring skeletal muscle by promoting a slow-to-fast fibre transition and \nimpairing mitochondrial biogenesis. This effect is mediated by IDH2 suppression \nvia H3K9me3 histone modification, contributing to systemic insulin resistance. \nTargeting IDH2 may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate \nmetabolic dysfunction in offspring exposed to maternal prepregnancy obesity.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Comprehensive understanding of HPA genetic \nprofiles at population level is essential for the prevention and management of \nthese medical conditions. Such data for HPA allele frequencies have been \ncollected for many ethnic groups in Peninsular Malaysia, but none from Sabah and \nSarawak of Borneo. This study aims to determine the frequencies of HPA alleles \nin Bajau, Kadazan-Dusun, Murut and Melanau populations of Borneo.\nMETHODOLOGY: Seven HPA loci (HPA-1 to -6 and -15) were genotyped using the \npolymerase chain reaction assay with sequence specific primers for 457 DNA \nsamples representing four Borneo indigenous groups.\nRESULTS: Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were \nobserved for HPA-3 in Bajau, Kadazan-Dusun, Murut and Melanau groups and for \nHPA-15 in Bajau and Murut. High frequencies of HPA-1a, -2a, -4a, -5a, and -6a \nalleles were observed across all four populations. Exact tests showed \nsignificant differentiation between Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia populations, \nparticularly for HPA-3 and -15. Principal component (PCA) analysis showed that \nthe Borneo indigenous groups clustered closely with other Austronesian \npopulations, consistent with the idea that they share genetic ancestry.\nCONCLUSION: Observed HPA allele frequency spectra are uniquely distributed in \nBajau, Kadazan-Dusun, Murut and Melanau population groups. The HPA population \ndatasets generated from this study can be used as guidelines for health policy \ndecision making and as reference sources for studying diseases associated with \nHPAs.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

It is highly prevalent in Sub-saharan Africa with Nigeria ranking \nhighest for people living with the disease. Blood pressure recording in \nindividuals with SCA has been known to be influenced by certain factors such as \nage, sex, body mass index and hemoglobin level.\nAIM: The study seeks to examine the relationship of certain pre-selected factors \n-age, gender, body mass index, disease severity and microalbuminuria/proteinuria \non the blood pressure of children with SCA and document the relationship (if \nany) between above factors and the blood pressure readings of Nigerian children \nwith SCA.\nMETHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional hospital-based study that consecutively recruited \n106 children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) aged 3-17 years in steady state as \nwell as age and sex-matched controls with HbAA genotype. Sociodemographic, \nclinical and anthropometric parameters were obtained. Severity of the disease \nand renal complication were assessed using Adeleke scoring method and \nmicroalbuminuria/ proteinuria assay. Subjects in crisis or had crisis in the \npast 4 weeks or genotype HbSC were excluded. For controls (genotype AA), those \non management for congenital heart disease (CHD), hypertension and renal \npathology were excluded.\nRESULTS: Weight and body mass index (BMI) were significantly lower in subjects \ncompared to controls (p = 0.010 & 0.029 respectively). In subjects, the most \ncommon clinical attributes at presentation was bone pain (31.1% subjects), \nprevious hospital admission (74.5%) and known steady state PCV (33.9%). Most of \nthe subjects (87.74%) had mild SCA disease severity. Only two subjects (1.8%) \nhad elevated BP while one subject (0.9%) had hypertension.Microalbuminuria \n(28.2%) and proteinuria (13.2%) were seen in subjects. While one control had \nelevated BP, none had hypertension. There was an initial positive relationship \nbetween increasing age (p= 0.007), low BMI (p= 0.008), presence of \nmicroalbuminuria/ proteinuria (Renal injury) p= 0.03 and raised blood \npressure,but none of these associations was found to be an independent predictor \nof hypertension.\nCONCLUSION/ RECOMMENDATION: Elevated diastolic blood pressure and diastolic \nhypertension in children with SCA were shown to have an initial positive \nassociation with increasing age, low BMI and renal injury. These should be \nguarded against by instituting screening program and measures to stall \nprogression.\n\nPublisher: CONTEXTE: L'an\u00e9mie falciforme (AF) est l'\u00e9tat homozygote du g\u00e8ne de \nl'h\u00e9moglobine SS.

We then determined \nassociations of these metabolic scores with glucose tolerance (in a separate set \nof \u223c700 IAs) and diabetes/metabolic risk in \u223c2,000 individuals (from Coronary \nArtery Risk Development in Young Adults [CARDIA] study). We used tissue-specific \ngene-metabolite mapping to pinpoint genetic pathways of type 2 diabetes (T2D) \nimplicated by metabolomic signatures.\nRESULTS: In young IAs (mean age 29 years; mean BMI 34.9 kg/m2) without diabetes, \nphenotype-metabolome associations across multiple insulin action phenotypes were \nlinked to mechanisms of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism and inflammation \n(among others). Metabolite-based scores of insulin action were strongly related \nto incident diabetes in our discovery IA population (Mlow; 49 metabolites; \nstandardized hazard ratio [HR] 0.49; 95% CI 0.35-0.69; P < 0.0001) and also \nassociated with measures of insulin resistance in a distinct IA population (|\u03c1| \n\u223c0.3-0.5 correlation) and in the CARDIA group (median age 33 years). At \u223c20 \nyears of follow-up in CARDIA, we observed a strong BMI- and glucose-independent \nassociation of the metabolite profile of Mlow (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.56-0.74; P < \n0.0001) and EGP suppression (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57-0.76; P < 0.0001) with \nincident diabetes, directionally opposed to BMI and glucose.

Patients may experience early-onset \nosteoarthritis, and in some cases, joint replacement therapy may be required. \nRadiographs are characterized by flat, small, and irregularly shaped epiphyses, \nespecially in the hips and knees. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasias are caused by \nvariants in the genes encoding important cartilage extracellular matrix \nproteins, enzymes, and transporter proteins, including COMP, MATN3, COL9A1, \nCOL9A2, COL9A3, CANT1, and SLC26A2. We aimed to investigate the clinical, \nradiographic, and molecular findings, along with the natural course of the \ndisease, in a group of patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The children \nwith a clinical diagnosis of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and their affected \nparents registered at our center over a period of 20\u00a0years were evaluated. The \nclinical and radiographic findings were reviewed. The genetic test was performed \nwhenever possible, with the aid of Sanger sequencing or exome sequencing as \nappropriate. A total of 27 patients (21 children and six affected parents) from \n14 unrelated families were clinically diagnosed with multiple epiphyseal \ndysplasia. The genetic etiology could be revealed in 25 patients (n\u2009=\u200925/27, \n92.5%) from 12 unrelated families. Of the 25 patients, 16 (64%) were male and \nnine (36%) were female. The age at genetic diagnosis ranged from 4 to 50\u00a0years, \nwith a median age of 10\u00a0years. Nine patients (9/25, 36%) had short stature, 17 \n(17/25, 68%) experienced joint pain, and seven (7/25, 28%) required orthopedic \nsurgery. The most frequent complaints leading to referral were joint pain and \ndifficulty walking. Genetic tests revealed a total of 12 variants in 12 \nfamilies, among which three were novel: COMP (13/25 patients, 52%; 7/12 \nfamilies, 58.3%), MATN3 (5/25 patients, 20%; 2/12 families, 16.6%), SLC26A2 \n(5/25 patients, 20%; 2/12 families, 16.6%), and COL9A2 (2/25 patients, 8%; 1/12 \nfamilies 8.3%). Of the patients who underwent orthopedic surgery (n\u2009=\u20097), five \nhad COMP variants. Patients with COMP variants exhibited a more severe \nphenotype, consistent with the literature.\nCONCLUSION: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasias represent a genetically heterogeneous \ngroup of disorders that may present clinical and diagnostic challenges. This \ncondition should be considered when evaluating patients who experience joint \npain and have radiographic findings suggestive of Perthes disease. A \ncomprehensive skeletal survey and genetic tests are essential for the accurate \ndiagnosis and management of this condition.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 MED represents one of the most prevalent categories of skeletal \ndysplasias, presenting clinically with progressive joint pain, skeletal \ndeformities, gait disturbances, or features suggestive of an underlying \nmyopathy.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 In this study, we present 25 patients with MED, identify three \nnovel variants, establish significant correlations between genotype and \nphenotype, and demonstrate how genetic analysis facilitates the differentiation \nof MED subtypes, thereby offering clearer insights into the genetic foundations \nand clinical implications of this condition.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In addition, the time constraints of the busy provider and poor integration of FHH with paper medical records or electronic medical records (EMR) impede its widespread use. The investigators hypothesize that patient-driven and electronic collection of FHH for risk stratification will promote more informed decision-making by patients and providers, and improves adherence to risk-stratified preventive care guidelines.

Podocytes, post-mitotic \nepithelial cells of the kidney filtration unit, bear limited regenerative \ncapacity, yet their survival is indispensable for kidney health. Podocyte loss \nis a hallmark of the aging process and of many diseases, but the underlying \nfactors remain unclear. We investigated the consequences of DNA damage in a \npodocyte-specific knockout mouse model for Ercc1 and in cultured podocytes under \ngenomic stress. Furthermore, we characterized DNA damage-related alterations in \nmouse and human renal tissue of different ages and patients suffering from \nminimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Ercc1 knockout \nresulted in accumulation of DNA damage, ensuing albuminuria and kidney disease. \nPodocytes reacted to genomic stress by activating mTORC1 signaling in vitro and \nin vivo. This was abrogated by inhibiting DNA damage signaling through DNA-PK \nand ATM kinases and inhibition of mTORC1 modulated the development of \nglomerulosclerosis. Perturbed DNA repair gene expression and genomic stress in \npodocytes was also detected in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Beyond that, \nDNA damage signaling occurred in podocytes of healthy aging mice and humans. We \nprovide evidence that genome maintenance in podocytes is linked to the mTORC1 \npathway, involved in the aging process and the development of \nglomerulosclerosis.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.172370\nPMID: 40392611", "authors": ["Braun F", "Mandel AM", "Blomberg L", "Wong MN", "Chatzinikolaou G", "Meyer DH", "Reinelt A", "Nair V", "Akbar-Haase R", "McCown PJ", "Haas F", "Chen H", "Rahmatollahi M", "Fermin D", "Ebbestad R", "Slaats GG", "Bork T", "Schell C", "Koehler S", "Brinkkoetter PT", "Lindenmeyer MT", "Cohen CD", "Kann M", "Unnersj\u00f6-Jess D", "Bloch W", "Sampson MG", "Doll\u00e9 ME", "Puelles VG", "Kretzler M", "Garinis GA", "Huber TB", "Schermer B", "Benzing T", "Schumacher B", "Kurschat CE"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392611/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:33:22.067698Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392611", "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.172370", "journal": "JCI insight"}}

Induction therapy has historically involved cyclophosphamide (CYC) and \nglucocorticoids (GCS), with rituximab (RTX) emerging as a preferred alternative. \nStudies addressed the efficacy of RTX in severe kidney diseases, showing results \ncomparable to CYC. In severe diseases that are unsuitable for high-dose CYC, \ncombined RTX and low-dose CYC demonstrate promising results. There is a recent \ntrend to administer low-dose GCS to reduce infections and other complications. \nRecent trials have questioned the broader role of plasma exchange (PLEX), \ninfluencing guidelines' updates. Current indications for PLEX include severe \nkidney dysfunction, positive glomerular basement membrane antibody, and diffuse \nalveolar hemorrhage that requires oxygen support at presentation. Maintenance \ntherapy options include azathioprine, RTX, and methotrexate. RTX's efficacy as a \nmaintenance agent was demonstrated in trials. However, controversies in dosing \nfrequency persist. The optimal duration of maintenance therapy remains debated, \nwith guidelines suggesting 18-48\u00a0months. More recent studies proposed longer \ndurations to reduce the risk of relapse, thus challenging existing guidelines. \nComplement involvement in AAV has been increasingly recognized. Studies show \nthat complement 3 depositions in the glomeruli correlate with severe disease and \ncomplement inhibitors such as avacopan demonstrated efficacy in the management \nof AAV. Other complement inhibitors, such as eculizumab and vilobelimab, are \nbeing explored. In conclusion, AAV management has made significant advances, but \ncontroversies persist. Future research should refine therapeutic regimens and \nexplore novel targeted treatments for personalized medicine in AAV.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

There is limited evidence of the impact of the \nFWC on maternal health. This paper used a cross-sectional study design to survey \n152 women enrolled in the Supporting Parents and Raising Resilient Kids (SPARRK) \nstudy in Flint, Michigan to examine racial differences in women's perceptions of \ntheir overall health pre- and post-FWC,\u00a0perceived maternal health services, and \nexplore the interaction of race and living in Flint on maternal morbidity.\nMETHODS: Perceived maternal health was defined using the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention's 21 Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) diagnosis codes. SMM \nwere obtained via questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to \nidentify factors associated with SMM within two domains: (1) overall health pre- \nand post-FWC and (2) perceived maternal health care received during birth.\nRESULTS: There were 17 cases of SMM in which Black women accounted for 62.5% of \nthese cases. Perceived quality of care was overall positive; yet, perceived \noverall health decreased post-FWC for all women. The odds of SMM were 6 times \nhigher for those who had a college degree or higher.\nCONCLUSION: In the predominately Black city of Flint, race was not a significant \nfactor in the perception of health and quality of care. Surprisingly, \neducational attainment was significantly associated with a 6-time increase in \nodds of experiencing an SMM. More research is needed to examine the association \nof patient-provider perception of quality care and education on maternal health \noutcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aimed to investigate the predictors \nof seizure freedom in patients with single supratentorial CCMs after \nmicrosurgical treatment.\nMETHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively obtained from 164 patients with CCM \n(including 98 patients with preoperative seizures, and 66 patients without \npreoperative seizures) who underwent microsurgical treatment between January \n2016 and December 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen \nUniversity.\nRESULTS: After microsurgical treatment, early postoperative seizures (\u2264\u20091 week) \noccurred in 2 of 98 (2.04%) and 2 of 66 (3.03%) CCM patients with and without \npreoperative seizures, respectively. The mean length of follow-up for all the \npatients was 44.70\u2009\u00b1\u20092.04 months (range: 1-98 months). Sixty-four of the 66 \n(96.97%) patients without preoperative seizures were seizure free during the \nfollow-up period. Among the patients with preoperative seizures, 77 of 98 \n(78.57%) patients achieved followed-up seizure remission, including 18 of 28 \n(64.29%) patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and 59 of 70 (84.29%) patients \nwith drug-controlled epilepsy. Univariate analysis indicated that preoperative \nseizure duration, drug-resistant epilepsy, tailored resection and the \napplication of intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) were important risk \nfactors that affected followed-up seizure remission among patients with \npreoperative seizures. However, according to multivariate regression, only the \nuse of intraoperative ECoG was an independent predictor related to the \nfollowed-up seizure remission.\nCONCLUSION: For CCM patients with preoperative seizures, intraoperative ECoG was \nan independent predictor of followed-up seizure remission.

It also explores the molecular \ndocking interactions of Withania somnifera (WS) leaf phytoconstituents with the \ndipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) receptor.\nMETHODOLOGY: A total of 20 rats were divided into 5 groups (G0: Normal diet, G1: \n0.25% WS leaves Extract, G3: 0.5% WS leaves Extract, G4: 0.5% WS leaves powder, \nand G5: 1% WS leaves powder) for 56\u2009days. The organ-to-body weight ratio, LFTs, \nRFTs, and hematological profile were determined in the 4th and 8th weeks. On the \nother hand, the structures of compounds identified from the methanolic extract \nof W. somnifera leaves were modified into PDBQT format to perform molecular \ndocking.\nRESULTS: The results showed that all parameters varied within normal ranges. The \nhematological parameters were higher in G2 after the 28th day compared to the \nvalues after the 56th day. The maximum values of serum glucose and lipid \nparameters were found in the G3 group as compared to other groups, while \nhepato-renal markers were high in G0.

Due \nto variability in diagnostic criteria and limited data, a comprehensive \nunderstanding of its epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management \nremains incomplete. To address these gaps, we performed a systematic literature \nreview employing stringent diagnostic criteria to evaluate epidemiologic \npatterns, clinical features, and therapeutic outcomes. Our analysis included 81 \npatients identified across 35 studies, revealing a median age of 45\u2009years and a \nnotable female predominance (2.25:1). Autoimmune diseases constituted the most \nfrequent underlying etiology, followed by hematologic malignancies and \ninfections. Patients exhibited significant anemia, with median nadir hemoglobin \nlevels reaching 5.6\u2009g/dL. Corticosteroids represented the most common \ntherapeutic intervention; however, only 43% of patients achieved remission, \nwhile 37% experienced chronic hemolysis, and mortality reached 11%. Many \npatients required multiple lines of therapy, including rituximab and cytotoxic \nagents, highlighting the disease's refractory nature and management complexity. \nThe substantial variability in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches emphasizes \nan urgent need for standardized diagnostic criteria, earlier integration of \ncombination therapies, and exploration of innovative treatment modalities. \nFuture prospective, multicenter studies are essential to refine disease \nrecognition, optimize therapeutic strategies, and ultimately improve patient \noutcomes in mixed AIHA.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Real-world physical and cognitive demands of grocery \nshopping occur simultaneously; however, many existing outcome measures only \ninclude a single domain or subtask. The objective of this review is to examine \nhow grocery shopping as a whole, or multiple simultaneous subtasks of grocery \nshopping, has been used as a functional outcomes measure.\nMETHODS: Peer-reviewed manuscripts in the English language were retrieved from \nPubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane published on or before December 20, 2024. \nArticles were included if an outcome measure included multiple subtasks of \ngrocery shopping and excluded if an outcome was related to only a single subtask \nof grocery shopping.

The most \ncommon populations studied were healthy adults (15) and psychiatric disorders \n(15). Common methods of assessment included patient-reported outcome measures \n(22), virtual reality (17), and physically simulated or real grocery shopping \n(20). Only three studies examined naturalistic, free-living grocery shopping. \nOutcomes were related to cognitive functioning (28), physical or motor \nimpairments (23), or behavioral aspects of shopping (9).\nCONCLUSIONS: This review provides critical insights into how grocery shopping \nhas been adopted as a performance outcome measure across populations and testing \nenvironments. Despite the growing recognition of grocery shopping as a useful \nmeasure, gaps remain in the literature, especially related to a lack of studies \nthat integrate cognitive and physical domains or explore its use in populations \nwith combined cognitive and physical impairments.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Cole et al.

Data from the United States Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting \nSystem (VAERS) indicate a higher proportion of adverse events (AEs) after \ninfluenza vaccination in hypertensive people. However, there is limited evidence \non AEs in hypertensive people following seasonal influenza vaccination. We \nidentified 4647 individuals aged 18 years or older with a history of \nhypertension who received seasonal influenza vaccination and 6380 seasonal \ninfluenza-vaccine-induced AEs between 1 January 2013 and 23 June 2023 from \nVAERS. We identified two groups for comparison: recovery and no recovery from \nseasonal influenza-vaccine-induced AEs. Propensity score matching (PSM) was \nperformed to adjust for potential confounding factors, including demographic \ncharacteristics (age, sex, and region) and season of onset. Cox regression \nanalysis was used to calculate the risk ratio of reported adverse events (AEs) \nthat affected recovery after seasonal influenza vaccination. Most AEs were \nnonserious and occurred within 48 hours. The most common AEs were general \ndisorders and administration site conditions (therapeutic and non-therapeutic \nresponses, inflammation) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n(musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort, bursal disorders, \njoint-related signs, and symptoms). All three types of seasonal influenza \nvaccines were associated with injection site reactions (47.07% trivalent \ninfluenza vaccine [TIA], hazard ratio, HR 2.04, 95% confidence interval, CI \n1.22-3.40; 20.00% quadrivalent influenza vaccine [QIA], HR 2.81, 95% CI, \n1.81-4.37; 67.48% influenza vaccine, unknown manufacturer [FLUX], HR 2.83, 95% \nCI, 1.12-7.15) and were the AEs affecting the largest proportion of delayed \nrecoveries in the hypertensive population. Potential AEs following seasonal \ninfluenza vaccination may affect the recovery of the hypertensive population. \nThe majority of AEs reported were general disorders, predominantly injection \nsite reactions, and nonserious.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Wu et al.

Digital health technologies, including mobile apps and web-based \nprograms, offer scalable tools to improve health behaviors, but their \neffectiveness in young populations remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile \nand web-based digital interventions in promoting healthy diets, reducing obesity \nrisk, increasing physical activity, and improving nutrition-related knowledge \nand attitudes among children and adolescents.\nMETHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of \nScience, and Google Scholar databases, along with hand-searching reference lists \nof key systematic reviews. The search encompassed records published up to \nSeptember 30, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials targeting \ndietary intake, anthropometric measurements, physical activity, or \nnutrition-related attitudes and knowledge among participants aged \u226418 years. \nScreening, full-text eligibility assessment, and data extraction were done \npartly in duplicate (20%; \u03ba=0.86 for title or abstract screening, \u03ba=0.71 for \nfull-text eligibility assessment, and \u03ba=0.78 data extraction). Risk of bias was \nevaluated using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (\u03ba=0.71 for interrater \nreliability of 20% duplicate evaluation). Data were synthesized narratively.\nRESULTS: From 300 records screened, a total of 37 articles (34 studies) were \nincluded. Interventions included games, (in 21/34 studies, 62%), mobile apps, \nweb-based programs, and other digital tools. Among the 34 included studies, 23 \n(68%) studies reported positive outcomes for at least 1 measured variable. Fruit \nintake improved in 17 of 34 studies (50%) assessing fruit intake, while 7 of 34 \nstudies (21%) targeting sugar-sweetened beverage consumption showed reductions. \nImprovements in nutrition knowledge were reported in 23 of 34 (68%) studies, but \nchanges in anthropometric measures and physical activity outcomes showed no \neffect.

The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been \nshown to decrease overall consumption of alcohol in AUD in addition to managing \nobesity and weight loss. The main objective of this narrative review was to \nexamine the potential benefits, dosages, and mechanisms of GLP-1 receptor \nagonists on alcohol consumption and how they can potentially modify \nalcohol-seeking behavior. Observations: The principal observation included the \neffect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on the mesolimbic pathways in the central \nnervous system, the central amygdala, and the GABAergic neurons in the central \nnervous system. Current research also focuses on the use of GLP-1 receptor \nagonists in improving glycemic control and reduction of obesity. Conclusions and \nRelevance: Clinically, GLP-1 receptor agonists can be potentially used as an \nadjunct to the treatment of AUD in patients with a body mass index >30 kg/m2 and \nin those with AUD who have coexisting diabetes mellitus. As decreasing glucose \nlevels and alcohol-seeking behavior are 2 dual effects of the GLP-1 receptor \nagonists, the dosage can be adjusted accordingly to achieve the desired benefits \nwhile reducing the potential side effects of the drug class.

However, the effects of Se and oxidized lipids on liver \noxidative stress and lipid metabolism, along with the underlying mechanisms, \nremain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of \nSe against liver injury induced by oxidized soybean oil (OSO) in mice. C57BL/6J \nmice (n = 60) were randomly divided into Control (0.2\u00a0mg/kg Se+7% fresh soybean \noil), OSO (0.2\u00a0mg/kg Se+7% OSO), and OSO+Se (1.0\u00a0mg/kg Se+7% OSO) groups for 10 \nweeks. The results showed that Se supplementation mitigated the morphological \nstructure and functional impairment, inflammation, and oxidative stress of the \nliver caused by OSO, and improved changes to the liver fatty acid profile and \nlipid metabolism disorders. It also reversed the OSO-induced imbalance of liver \npolyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites and inhibited OSO-induced activation of \nthe PI3K-AKT pathway. Se may activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit the PI3K-AKT \npathway to improve inflammation, oxidative stress, and fatty acid metabolism \ndisorders, thereby reducing liver injury.

Because there are only 16 G\u03b1 proteins that can couple to GPCRs, \nvariation in a single G\u03b1 can affect the function of numerous receptors. Here, we \ninvestigated two mutant forms of G\u03b1s (L388R and E392K) that are associated with \npseudohypoparathyroidism type Ic (PHPIc), a maternally inherited rare disease. \nG\u03b1s is encoded by an imprinted gene, resulting in the mutant form of G\u03b1s being \nthe only version of the protein present in certain tissues, which leads to \ntissue-specific disease manifestations. By integrating data from \nthree-dimensional structures, GPCR-G protein coupling specificity, \ntranscriptomics, biophysics, and molecular dynamics with systems pharmacology \nmodeling, we identified GPCRs whose signaling could be altered by G\u03b1s mutations \nin the kidney, a tissue involved in the pathophysiology of PHPIc. Analysis of G \nprotein activation by the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) revealed that \nL388R impaired G\u03b1s interaction with the receptor, whereas E392K reduced the \nreceptor-induced activation of heterotrimeric Gs. This indicates that different \nsignal transduction steps can be altered by specific G\u03b1s mutants associated with \nthe same disease. These findings highlight the importance of investigating \nmutation-specific perturbations in GPCR signaling to suggest patient-specific \ntreatment strategies. Furthermore, our methods provide a blueprint for \ninterrogating GPCR signaling diversity in different physiological and \npathophysiological contexts.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/scisignal.ado7543\nPMID: 40392940", "authors": ["Redfern-Nichols T", "O'Brien SL", "Huang X", "Medel-Lacruz B", "Calebiro D", "Selent J", "Ladds G", "Marti-Solano M"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392940/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:34:46.511631Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392940", "doi": "10.1126/scisignal.ado7543", "journal": "Science signaling"}}

Additionally, data were analyzed by separating \npatients with treatment-free interval (TFI)\u2009<\u200912\u00a0months (deemed resistant to ET) \nfrom the first-line treatment group (hereafter, the exclusive first-line \ntreatment group).\nRESULTS: Data from 745 patients were analyzed. Compared with palbociclib, \nabemaciclib was used in younger patients and those with expected poor prognosis. \nMedian rwPFS was 36.8, 17.8, and 31.4\u00a0months in patients with de novo stage IV \ndisease, TFI\u2009<\u200912\u00a0months, and TFI\u2009\u2265\u200912\u00a0months, respectively, in the first-line \ntreatment group, and 17.4\u00a0months in the second-line treatment group. In the \nexclusive first-line treatment group, median rwPFS of the subsequent treatment \nafter initial CDK4/6i plus ET was\u2009<\u20097\u00a0months, regardless of the type of \nsubsequent treatment; prognosis was especially poor in those who were switched \nto chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The real-world survival outcomes found in this study for patients \nreceiving first-/second-line CDK4/6i therapy were consistent with those of \nrandomized phase 3 studies. As outcomes of subsequent treatment after initial \nCDK4/6i plus ET remain insufficient, further improvement in treatment is \nnecessary.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

These patients underwent surgery-based multidisciplinary treatment. \nCollected data included demographics, pathologies, symptoms, surgery-related \ndata, adjuvant therapies, postoperative events, and survival data. The primary \noutcome was overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted. \nUnivariate analysis employed the log-rank test, and post-hoc multivariate \nanalysis utilized the Cox regression model.\nRESULTS: The mean age was 50.9\u00a0years. 72 cases (92.3%) reported locoregional \npain, and 30 cases (38.5%) presented with neurological dysfunction. The primary \npathological subtype was invasive ductal carcinoma (83.3%).\nSURGICAL PROCEDURES: total en-bloc spondylectomy (6.4%), debulking surgery \n(61.5%), palliative surgery (32.1%). Postoperatively, both pain and neurological \nfunction significantly improved (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, \nchemotherapy/targeted therapy were given to 56.4%, 60.3%, 61.5% patients, \nrespectively. The estimated OS was 50.0\u00a0months. Tomita's scores (P\u2009=\u20090.355) and \nTokuhashi's scores (P\u2009=\u20090.461) showed no significant OS association. Univariate \nanalysis indicated that preoperative neurological dysfunction (P\u2009=\u20090.003), \npostoperative neurological dysfunction (P\u2009=\u20090.051), adjuvant endocrine therapy \n(P\u2009=\u20090.025), and hormone receptor expression status (P\u2009=\u20090.009) were associated \nwith patient survival. Multivariate analysis identified endocrine therapy as an \nindependent protective factor for prognosis (aHR\u2009=\u20090.070, 95% CI 0.007-0.727, \nP\u2009=\u20090.026).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with BCSM have experienced prolonged survival. \nNeurological status, adjuvant anti-drugs, and expression of hormone receptors \nplayed crucial roles in predicting survival. Conventional prognostic systems may \nrequire modification to incorporate these factors. However, this study has \nlimitations inherent to its retrospective design, single-center cohort, and \nrelatively small sample size, which may affect generalizability.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Over the past 20 years, longitudinal studies \nhave helped differentiate the influence of chronological aging from ovarian \naging on cardiovascular health. In addition to the pronounced sex hormone \nchanges of the menopause transition (MT), the MT is also often accompanied by \nvasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, and mental health changes that impact \nwomen's cardiovascular health. The purpose of this invited review is to \nhighlight the key changes that can alter CVD risk. Given the gaps in medical \ntraining, we also describe the need for specialized postgraduate curriculum in \nmanaging the MT with an aim to improve MT screening and management of CVD during \nthis universal life stage. Finally, we propose a multidisciplinary approach led \nby experts in women's cardiovascular health and present an approach utilizing \nvalidated screening tools and CVD risk scores to discuss the candidacy of \nsystemic menopause hormone therapy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

Currently, a considerable amount of literature has \nconsistently shown that thermal ablation is effective in maintaining parathyroid \nhormone levels within an appropriate range, normalizing calcium and phosphorus \nlevels, improving clinical symptoms, and reducing the volume of parathyroid \nglands. However, there are currently no established guidelines regarding its \nutilization. The Asian consensus statement of experts on thermal ablation for \nSHPT in chronic kidney disease was jointly initiated by experts from China and \nKorea in the fields of nephrology, interventional ultrasound or radiology, \nthyroid surgery, ultrasound medicine, nuclear medicine, and diagnostic \nradiology-to formulate recommendations aimed at establishing standardized \nprotocols for thermal ablation targeting the parathyroid glands. Based on the \nsystematic review of literatures related to ultrasound-guided thermal ablation \nof parathyroid glands and the professional opinions of experts, the consensus \nstatement covers the relevant content regarding thermal ablation treatment for \nSHPT, including indications, contraindications, pre-ablation evaluation, \noperational procedures, post-ablation follow-up, therapeutic effect evaluation, \ncomplications prevention and treatment. According to the Grading of \nRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, a total of 18 \nrecommendations were given. This consensus statement will positively promote the \nstandardization of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation of parathyroid glands.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

First, it is the consequence of insulin resistance due to the modifications of the pregnancy hormonal environment, and second, of the deficiency of the beta cells of the pancreas to respond by a sufficient insulin secretion. This physiopathology is closely connected to the one of type 2 diabetes. Insulin, indeed, can remedy these 2 etiologies, but it is logical to think about using oral hypoglycemic agents which have been created to treat them: they are a natural choice because they improve insulin sensitivity (metformin, a biguanide) or insulin secretion (glyburide, a sulfonylurea). It also seems natural to use them in combination, glyburide being added to metformin if needed.\n\nOUR GENERAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS IS THAT: in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus, using both oral hypoglycemic agents (glyburide added to metformin if needed) allows a glycemic control comparable to the one obtained with insulin, but with a better acceptability from women and a better health status, diabetes treatment satisfaction and well-being and a reduced postnatal depression.", "authors": ["Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"], "publication_date": "2018-05-03T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01215331", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:35:00.346231Z", "metadata": {"nctId": "NCT01215331", "status": "COMPLETED", "studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE3"], "conditions": ["Gestational Diabetes Mellitus"], "interventions": ["Insulin", "Metformin, glyburide and insulin"]}}

These syndromes have great phenotypic overlap and variability, even \nwithin families. To facilitate the differentiation of Miller syndrome from \nrelated facial dysostosis syndromes, such as Treacher Collins and Nager \nsyndrome, this study aims to provide an overview of the phenotypic spectrum of \nthe syndrome. A systematic literature search of Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of \nScience, and CINAHL was conducted until November 2024. Case reports and case \nseries of patients with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of Miller syndrome in \nall languages were included. The quality of the included reports was assessed \nusing the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool and the Fichas de \nLectura Critica 3.0 web application. In total, 44 cases of Miller syndrome were \nfound, with only 18.2% having genetic confirmation. Craniofacial anomalies were \nprominent, including midface hypoplasia (72.7%) and micrognathia (75.0%), \norofacial clefts (77.3%), eyelid anomalies (70.5%), and external ear anomalies \n(63.6%). Limb anomalies were present in all cases, primarily involving the hands \n(95.5%), forearms (52.3%), and feet (90.9%). Anomalies in other \nextracraniofacial tracts were also reported. Despite limitations, including \nlimited genetic confirmation and reliance on literature, this study provides \nvaluable insights into the phenotypic spectrum of Miller syndrome. Efforts for \ngenetic confirmation, international collaboration, and comprehensive reporting \nare essential to advance research and care for rare conditions like Miller \nsyndrome. Therefore, a detailed checklist for phenotypic evaluation in Miller \nsyndrome cases is provided in this study.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

These bacteria are a normal component of human \nflora; however, they can become pathogenic in susceptible hosts by entering \nthrough mucosal defects and disseminating submucosally to involve the \nsurrounding tissue. Cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common presentation; \nhowever, Actinomyces can rarely involve other aspects of the head and neck. \nActinomycosis in this region is often mistaken for other disease processes, \ngiven its tendency to mimic other pathologies. We present a unique case of a \n72-year-old male presenting with acute respiratory compromise due to submucosal \nactinomycosis of both the hypopharynx and the larynx requiring an emergent \nsurgical airway. Many aspects of this patient's presentation were highly \nsuspicious of malignancy, including medical history, presenting symptoms, \nflexible laryngoscopy findings, CT results, and intraoperative appearance of the \nlesions. Actinomycosis should remain on the differential in patients with a \nsubmucosal laryngeal mass with clinical and radiographic evidence of extra \nlaryngeal extension, especially in patients with a history of mucosal trauma, \npoor dentition, or an immunocompromised state. Multiple biopsies should be \nobtained, with definitive surgical treatment planning pending final pathology.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/01455613241306020\nPMID: 40380874", "authors": ["Masliah J", "Raad R", "Shah A", "Stenson K"], "publication_date": "2025 May 17", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40380874/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:35:08.957899Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40380874", "doi": "10.1177/01455613241306020", "journal": "Ear, nose, & throat journal"}}

Cephalgia occupies an important place among such algic \nforms as fibromyalgia, back pain, and abdominal and joint pain. Headaches and \nsleep disturbances may be independent, derived from a single pathogenetic \nfactor, or their relationship may be bidirectional. This review focuses on the \nreciprocal relationship between headaches and sleep disorders; particular \nattention is paid to the morning headache variant associated with obstructive \nsleep apnea (OSA). Modern data on the anatomical structures and \npathophysiological mechanisms common to disorders in the regulation of the \nsleep-wake cycle and the perception of pain impulses are presented. Possible \npathogenetic processes and nuances of differential diagnosis of headaches \nassociated with sleep apnea are discussed. Methods of treating headaches \nassociated with sleep disorders, in particular OSA-associated cephalgia, are \naddressed. The effectiveness of therapy with constant positive airway pressure \n(CPAP therapy) and splint therapy for OSA has been shown for headaches \nassociated with sleep apnea.\n\nPublisher: \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438, \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \n\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432. \u0412\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0440\u044f\u0434\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u043b\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0444\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0433\u0438\u044f, \n\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u0430\u0431\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0446\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043b\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044b. \n\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \n\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0432\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440. \n\u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \n\u0441\u043d\u0430;

Electronic address: ymlee3060@gmail.com.\n(2)BOAZ Ear, Nose & Throat Clinic, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\n\nOBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Vocal development is crucial for children's speech and \nlanguage acquisition, allowing them to produce sounds, form words, and construct \nsentences for verbal communication. This study examined the vocal development \ntrajectory in children who received early simultaneous bilateral cochlear \nimplants (CIs) and compared it to age-matched children with typical hearing \n(TH).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case-control study design.\nMETHODS: Participants included nine children who received simultaneous bilateral \nCIs between 7 and 20\u00a0months of age and eight age-matched children with TH. \nParent-child play interactions were video- and audio-recorded at 6-month \nintervals. Child vocalizations were categorized into four categories: \nnoncanonical babbling, canonical babbling, words, and sentences. Developmental \ntrajectories and group differences were analyzed over three points: initial \nvisit, 6\u00a0months, and 12\u00a0months after the initial visit (mean age at the first \nsession: 19.76\u00a0months; standard deviation: 4.89; range: 12-28\u00a0months).\nRESULTS: Both groups showed an increase in total vocalizations and advanced \nforms over 1\u00a0year. However, the CI group produced a significantly lower \nproportion of words and sentences and a higher proportion of noncanonical \nbabbling than the TH group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although children with early-identified hearing loss and \nsimultaneous bilateral CIs make significant progress in vocal development, their \nvocal milestones remain delayed compared to those of their peers with TH. These \nchildren do not fully catch up in vocal development within 1 to 2\u00a0years of \nbilateral CI use. These findings highlight the need for targeted support and \nearly intervention for children with CIs and their parents.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It clinically mimics submandibular gland \nneoplasms and has a possible association with IgG4-related disease. The \nliterature on standardised diagnostic and management pathways is limited. This \npaper presents a case series and narrative literature review to support a \nproposed diagnostic and management approach for Kuttner's tumour. Methods: \nTwelve cases of patients with a Kuttner's tumour aged between 55 and 87, \nidentified from 2018 to 2025 through hospital records, were reviewed. All \npatients underwent ultrasound assessment using standardised diagnostic criteria \nand were followed up clinically and radiologically every six months. In \nparallel, we performed a narrative review of studies published between 2005 and \n2025, identifying nine relevant articles to contextualise our findings. Results: \nOur 12-patient case series highlights the potential for Kuttner's tumour to \nprogress to bilateral involvement and IgG4-related disease. Most cases resolved \nspontaneously with ultrasound-led monitoring. One progressed to IgG4-RD and \nresponded to glucocorticoids. Our findings support the selective use of invasive \ntests, baseline serum IgG4 testing, and a six-monthly follow-up strategy. \nDespite similarities within the existing literature, international variation \nhighlights the need for standardised diagnostic and management protocols. \nConclusions: We recommend a conservative, structured approach to managing \nKuttner's tumour, with six-monthly clinical and radiological follow-ups. Based \non one case progressing to multi-organ IgG4-related disease, we now recommend \nroutinely measuring serum IgG4 concentrations at diagnosis. The role of magnetic \nresonance imaging, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and biopsy should be \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. Further research is needed to validate this \napproach and assess long-term outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/jcm14093208\nPMCID: PMC12072982\nPMID: 40364239\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "authors": ["Al-Deerawi Z", "El-Badawi K", "Shrivastava A", "Barrak H"], "publication_date": "2025 May 6", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40364239/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:35:16.593422Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40364239", "doi": "10.3390/jcm14093208", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine"}}

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass \nspectrometry was used to measure >1,000 serum and urine metabolites. Average \ndaily UPF intake was estimated as percentage energy according to the Nova \nsystem. Partial Spearman correlations and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection \nOperator (LASSO) regression were used to estimate UPF-metabolite correlations \nand build poly-metabolite scores of UPF intake, respectively. Scores were tested \nin a post-hoc analysis of a previously conducted randomized, controlled, \ncrossover-feeding trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03407053) of 20 subjects who \nwere admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to consume ad libitum \ndiets that were 80% or 0% energy from UPF for 2 weeks immediately followed by \nthe alternate diet for 2 weeks; eligible subjects were between 18-50 years old \nwith a body mass index of >18.5\u00a0kg/m2 and weight-stable. IDATA participants were \n51% female, and 97% completed \u22654 ASA-24s. Mean intake was 50% energy from UPF. \nUPF intake was correlated with 191 (of 952) serum and 293 (of 1,044) 24-h urine \nmetabolites (FDR-corrected P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.01), including lipid (n\u00a0=\u00a056 serum, \nn\u00a0=\u00a022 24-h urine), amino acid (n\u00a0=\u00a033, 61), carbohydrate (n\u00a0=\u00a04, 8), xenobiotic \n(n\u00a0=\u00a033, 70), cofactor and vitamin (n\u00a0=\u00a09, 12), peptide (n\u00a0=\u00a07, 6), and \nnucleotide (n\u00a0=\u00a07, 10) metabolites. Using LASSO regression, 28 serum and 33 24-h \nurine metabolites were selected as predictors of UPF intake; \nbiospecimen-specific scores were calculated as a linear combination of selected \nmetabolites. Overlapping metabolites included (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine \nsulfoxide (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, -0.19), N2,N5-diacetylornithine (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.27 for serum, \n-0.26 for 24-h urine), pentoic acid (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.30, -0.32), and \nN6-carboxymethyllysine (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 0.20). Within the cross-over feeding trial, \nthe poly-metabolite scores differed, within individual, between UPF diet phases \n(P-value for paired t test\u00a0<\u00a00.001). IDATA Study participants were older US \nadults whose diets may not be reflective of other populations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Poly-metabolite scores, developed in IDATA participants with \nvarying diets, are predictive of UPF intake and could advance epidemiological \nresearch on UPF and health. Poly-metabolite scores should be evaluated and \niteratively improved in populations with a wide range of UPF intake.\n\nCopyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be \nfreely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise \nused by anyone for any lawful purpose.

There is conflicting \ndata on the FNMTC aggressiveness compared with sporadic DTC (sDTC), leading to \nusually more extensive therapy applied for FNMTC, given its autosomal dominant \ngenetic background. This study aimed to compare the progression-free survival \n(PFS) in patients with FNMTC and sDTC treated with standard therapy. Methods: \nThis longitudinal retrospective cohort study included patients with FNMTC, \ndefined as at least two first-degree relatives affected by DTC. FNMTC patients \nwere matched with sDTC in a 1:3 ratio based on age, sex, American Thyroid \nAssociation recurrence risk stratification (ATA-R), extent of initial surgery, \nand diagnosis date. The primary outcome was PFS. Kaplan-Meier curves were used \nto compare PFS between the groups, and the Cox proportional hazards model was \nused to assess confounders. Results: From 95 affected FNMTC patients, 30 were \nexcluded due to lack of follow-up data. The study population consisted of 65 \nFNMTC and 170 sDTC patients, with a median follow-up of 4.73 (2.87-10.27) years \nfor FNMTC and 5.83 (2.33-10.79) years for sDTC (p = 0.76). There was 100% \nmatching for ATA-R, sex, surgery type, and year of surgery and a satisfactory \nmatching for age (43.12\u2009\u00b1\u200915.11 vs. 42.76\u2009\u00b1\u200912.46 years, p = 0.85). FNMTC \nexhibited a smaller tumor size (1.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96 vs. 1.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.51 cm, p < 0.01) and \nfewer positive lymph nodes (range 0-13 vs. 0-38, p = 0.009) at presentation. The \nrate of repeated neck surgeries for persistent/recurrent disease was comparable \nbetween the groups: 13.8% (9/65) for FNMTC vs. 17.7% (30/170) for sDTC (p = \n0.48). There was no difference in radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy dosage \nbetween the groups (104 [100-149] vs. 106 [76-160] mCi, p = 0.82). During \nfollow-up, 15.4% of FNMTC and 18.2% of sDTC patients experienced disease \nprogression (p = 0.61). PFS was non-different between groups (p = 0.56) and was \nassociated with ATA-R (high vs. low hazard ratio [HR]: 9.2, confidence interval \n[CI]: 2.67-31.85, p < 0.001) and sex (male vs. female, HR: 2.5, CI: 1.11-5.6, p \n= 0.026). Conclusions: No difference in PFS between FNMTC and sDTC patients \nsuggests comparable responsiveness to standard therapy. Therefore, the \nmanagement of FNMTC should align with the standard of care for DTC to avoid \novertreatment of FNMTC.\n\nDOI: 10.1089/thy.2024.0588\nPMID: 40392709", "authors": ["Chuki E", "Behairy N", "Auh S", "Makarewicz A", "Uttarkar Vikram CN", "Kumari S", "Veeraraghavan P", "Cochran C", "Gubbi S", "Klubo-Gwiezdzinska J"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392709/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:35:30.413141Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392709", "doi": "10.1089/thy.2024.0588", "journal": "Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association"}}

Initial evaluations revealed ST-T changes alongside elevated \ntroponin I levels. Echocardiography revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection \nfraction (LVEF) of 25-30% and apical wall motion abnormalities. Hence, coronary \nangiography was performed, which showed no significant coronary stenosis, \nsupporting a diagnosis of TTS. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram \ndemonstrated a normalized LVEF four weeks later, confirming the provisional \ndiagnosis.\nDISCUSSION: This case highlights the necessity for clinicians to be vigilant for \nTTS in patients with Acute cardiac conditions, specifically in patients \nundergoing significant physiological stress, such as post-surgery or following \nnorepinephrine administration.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Optimizing dual antiplatelet \ntherapy (DAPT) is essential for improving clinical outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether an 11-month, unguided deescalation strategy from \nticagrelor to clopidogrel was associated with reduced bleeding without an \nincrease in ischemic events in stabilized patients with CKD after AMI.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a post hoc secondary analysis of the \nmulticenter, open-label, Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel in Stabilized Patients With \nAcute Myocardial Infarction (TALOS-AMI) randomized clinical trial conducted at \n32 major cardiac centers in South Korea. Patients with biomarker-positive AMI \nwho tolerated 1 month of ticagrelor-based DAPT after PCI were included in the \ntrial. Patient enrollment occurred from February 2014 to December 2018, with \nfollow-up at 30 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after PCI. The present analysis \nfocused on the subgroup of patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration \nrate [eGFR]<60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Data analyses were performed from July 2023 to \nOctober 2024.\nINTERVENTIONS: In the TALOS-AMI trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to continue \nticagrelor (active control group) or switch to clopidogrel (deescalation group) \nfor 11 months after PCI.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a composite of death from \ncardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding (Bleeding \nAcademic Research Consortium [BARC] types 2, 3, or 5).\nRESULTS: Of 2646 patients included in the trial, 305 had CKD (11.5%; mean [SD] \nage, 67.2 [11.4] years; 223 males [73.1%]; mean [SD] eGFR, 49.7 [9.5] \nmL/min/1.73 m2) and 2341 did not have CKD (1975 male [84.4%]; mean [SD] age, \n59.0 [11.0] years). Patients with CKD had an increased risk of ischemic events \ncompared with patients without CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.47; 95% CI, 1.38-4.42; \nP\u2009=\u2009.002), but there was no difference in bleeding risk (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, \n0.80-2.31; P\u2009=\u2009.26). Among patients with CKD, deescalation (n\u2009=\u2009160) vs active \ncontrol (n\u2009=\u2009145) was associated with reduced risks of the primary end point (10 \npatients [6.2%] vs 19 [13.1%]; HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21-0.98]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and BARC \n2, 3, or 5 bleeding (4 patients [2.5%] vs 12 [8.3%]; HR, 0.29 [95% CI, \n0.09-0.89]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). No increased risk of ischemic events was observed \nfollowing deescalation (7 patients [4.4%] vs 8 [5.5%]; HR, 0.78 [95% CI, \n0.28-2.16]; P\u2009=\u2009.64).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical \ntrial, deescalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel at 1 month after PCI for AMI \nwas associated with significant reduction in bleeding without increased risk of \nischemic events among study-eligible patients with CKD.

These diseases are responsible for morbidity and \nmortality, leading to a substantial burden on healthcare systems and economic \nresources. Numerous innovative therapies have been proposed for combating cancer \nand cardiovascular disease like thrombosis; however, many of these treatments \ninvolve synthetic drugs that may have undesirable side effects. Consequently, \nthe current research aimed to explore the medicinal properties of phytochemicals \nderived from Magnolia champaca L. This investigation utilized both in vitro and \nin silico approaches. The identification of phytocompounds were employed by \nusing ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Thrombolytic activity was assayed using human venous \nblood and cytotoxicity was assessed through lethality test using nauplii of \nArtemia salina and finally the molecular docking analysis was performed using a \ndocking software named AutoDock Vina to clearly understand about the \ninteractions of GC-MS identified secondary metabolites with target proteins. The \nATR-FTIR spectrum of Magnolia champaca specifies the presence of some alkaloids, \npolysaccharides, flavonoids as well as glycosidic phytocompounds and GC-MS data \nidentified 23 compounds from crude methanolic extract and among them \n2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol; 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Hexadecanoic acid, \nmethyl ester; Di-n-octyl phthalate were prominent. The in vitro thrombolytic \nassay demonstrated that Trans-Syringin and CHF resulted in significant blood \nclot lysis, achieving 59.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.79\u00a0% and 45.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.63\u00a0% respectively comparing \n75.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.96\u00a0% with standard streptokinase. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated \nmoderate to strong toxicological effect. Specifically, Trans-Syringin and the \nethyl acetate fraction (EAF) demonstrated considerable cytotoxicity, showing the \nnet values of LC50 were 22.39\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and 61.78\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively contrary to \n11.45\u00a0\u00b5g/ml of vincristine sulfate (standard). Molecular docking analysis were \nconducted to explore the synergistic effects of the compounds identified through \nGC-MS analysis on tissue plasminogen activator and human topoisomerase-II. The \ncompounds 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Cadina-1(10),4-diene and \n1,1,7-Trimethyl-4-methylenedecahydro-1H-cyclopropa[e]azulen-7-ol-, \n(1aR-(1a.alpha.,4a.alpha.,7.beta.,7a.beta.,7b.alpha.))- demonstrated high \nbinding affinities of -7.7, -7.3, and -7.1\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively, for tissue \nplasminogen activator where streptokinase (standard) had -6.5\u00a0kcal/mol. For \nhuman topoisomerase-II, 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Caryophyllene-(I1) \nand Cadina-1(10),4-diene exhibited binding affinities of -8.0, -7.9 as well as \n-7.8\u00a0kcal/mol correspondingly, while standard vincristine had -8.1\u00a0kcal/mol. \nThese findings suggest that Magnolia champaca contains active phytochemicals \nwith significant potentials for diverse pharmacological applications.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

The mummy of a 35-45 year old male, \nradiocarbon dated to the period 1730-1780 CE is most likely that of the local \naristocratic parish vicar Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg who had been \ntemporarily delegated to St. Thomas parish from his mother monastery of \nWaldhausen im Strudengau (Upper Austria). He had a high-quality diet based on \nterrestrial animal products, showed no signs of major physical work load, was \nmost likely a pipe smoker and suffered from chronic active pulmonary \ntuberculosis with peripheral and central (hilar) calcifications (primary \ntuberculous complex) and a right lower lobe cavity with focal heterotopic \nossification and potential active inflammation. This latter may have caused \nacute pulmonary hemorrhage which may have been the cause of death. Most \nsurprisingly, we detected, in the otherwise completely intact abdominal (and \npelvic) cavity, extensive packing with foreign material which was identified as \na mixture of wood chips, fragmented twigs, large amounts of fabric of various \ntypes including elaborate embroidered linen, and even pieces of silk. \nFurthermore, this embalming method seems to have included high level zinc-ion \nsolution impregnation (most likely zinc-chloride with small amounts of arsenic) \nand the addition of copper.

First, the reports of \nantipsychotics were extracted from the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System \n(FAERS), and the signals of AP were detected by four pharmacovigilance \nalgorithms. The gene targets of drugs were predicted using multiple databases. \nThe disease targets of AP were determined by bioinformatics methods. \nProtein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted using STRING database, \ngene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis \nwere also performed through R software. Molecular docking was applied to test \nthe molecular affinity using AutoDock.\nRESULTS: The signal intensity of AP was statistically significant in olanzapine, \nquetiapine, and fluphenazine. Due to the small number of reports associated with \nAP AEs on fluphenazine, our subsequent studies mainly focused on olanzapine and \nquetiapine. The results of stratification analysis suggested robustness of our \nresults. Age \u226465, female, and weight >80\u00a0kg were identified as risk factors of \nthe development of AP in patients receiving olanzapine, while weight >80\u00a0kg and \nage \u226465 were risk factors of that in patients receiving quetiapine. Network \ntoxicology analysis and molecular docking suggested that olanzapine and \nquetiapine may exert their toxic effects through acting on hub genes.\nCONCLUSION: The pharmacovigilance analysis investigated the signal intensity, \nclinical features, risk factors, and onset time of AP associated with olanzapine \nand quetiapine.

In this study, we investigated the interplay between cigarette \nsmoke, DNA damage and repair, focusing on the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) \nprotein Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group C (XPC). We found decreased XPC mRNA \nexpression in most NSCLCs compared to subject-matched, non-cancerous lung. In \nnon-cancerous bronchial epithelial cells, cigarette smoke decreased NER, \nincreased total DNA damage and resultant apoptosis, each exacerbated by XPC \ndeficiency. In contrast, lung cancer cells exhibit greater resilience to \ncigarette smoke, requiring higher doses to induce comparable DNA damage and \napoptosis, and are less reliant on XPC expression for survival. Importantly, XPC \nprotects against chromosomal instability in benign bronchial epithelial cells, \nbut not in lung cancer cells. Our findings support a \"double hit\" mechanism \nwherein early decreased XPC expression and resultant aberrant DNA repair, when \ncombined with cigarette smoke exposure, may lead to loss of non-malignant \nepithelial cells (as observed in COPD), and contributes to early NSCLC \ntransition through altered DNA damage response.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.28724\nPMID: 40391767 [Indexed for MEDLINE]", "authors": ["Nasrallah NA", "Lee B", "Wiese BM", "Karam MN", "Mickler EA", "Zhou H", "Paolelli N", "Stearman RS", "Geraci MW", "Sears CR"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40391767/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:36:08.940987Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40391767", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.28724", "journal": "Oncotarget"}}

However, this progress also comes with medical, economic, \nand ethical challenges, which can negatively affect children's quality of life. \nObjective: This study examines the quality of care of children with malignant \nand non-malignant conditions at the end of life. Design: A two-year cohort \nretrospective analysis was conducted. Setting/Subjects: The study included all \nchildren who died between December 1, 2021, and December 1, 2023, in a tertiary \ncenter in Saudi Arabia. Measurements: Data included. information on children's \ndemographics, medical history, EOL care, and healthcare services utilization. \nResults: A total of 302 deaths were analyzed, 42% of infants. The most frequent \nconditions were cardiac diseases (30.1%) and malignancy (20.9%). Two-thirds had \na Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation (DNAR) (66.6%), with most officialized in the \nIntensive Care Unit (ICU). Two-thirds had no advanced directives (66.9%).

In this study, we present a tumor-agnostic, platform-independent CTC \ndetection strategy based on recognition of the cancer-specific glycosylation, \noncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS). Through coupling of the ofCS-binding \nprotein, VAR2CSA, to a fluorophore-carrying dextran polymer, we successfully \ndetected ofCS-positive CTCs from blood samples in two diverse and independent \ncohorts comprising early- and late-stage cancer patients of both epithelial and \nnon-epithelial tumor origin.

Electronic address: kerir@ccf.org.\n\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive disease with limited \napproved therapeutic options. The rapid growth and genomic instability of TNBC \ncells makes mitosis a compelling target, and a current mainstay of treatment is \npaclitaxel (Ptx), a taxane that stabilizes microtubules during mitosis. While \ninitially effective, acquired resistance to Ptx is common, and other antimitotic \ntherapies can be similarly rendered ineffective due to the development of \nresistance or systemic toxicity underscoring the need for new therapeutic \napproaches. Interrogating CRISPR essentiality screens in TNBC cell lines, we \nidentified PAFAH1B1 (LIS1) as a potential vulnerability in this disease. \nPAFAH1B1 regulates mitotic spindle orientation, proliferation, and cell \nmigration during neurodevelopment, yet little is known regarding its function in \nbreast cancer. We found that suppressing PAFAH1B1 expression in TNBC cells \nreduces cell number, while non-malignant cells remain unaffected. PAFAH1B1 \nsuppression alters cell cycle dynamics, increasing mitotic duration and \naccumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. The suppression of PAFAH1B1 expression \nalso increases DNA double-strand breaks, indicating a requirement for sustained \nPAFAH1B1 expression to maintain the genomic integrity of TNBC cells. Lastly, \nPAFAH1B1 silencing substantially enhances these defects in cells that are \ntaxane-resistant and sensitizes both parental and Ptx-resistant TNBC cells to \nPtx. These results indicate that LIS1/PAFAH1B1 may be a novel target for the \ndevelopment of new anti-mitotic agents for treating TNBC, particularly in the \ncontext of paclitaxel resistance.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

Many relationship categories (e.g. half-sibships versus avuncular) can \nbe difficult to distinguish without external information. Pedigree inference \nalgorithms are often trained on European-descent families in urban locations. \nThus, existing methods tend to perform poorly in endogamous populations for \nwhich there may be reticulations within the pedigrees and elevated haplotype \nsharing. We present a simple, rapid algorithm which initially uses only \nhigh-confidence first-degree relationships to seed a machine learning step based \non summary statistics of identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing. One of these \nstatistics, our ``haplotype score'', is novel and can be used to: (1) \ndistinguish half-sibling pairs from avuncular or grandparent-grandchildren \npairs; and (2) assign individuals to ancestor versus descendant generation. We \ntest our approach in a sample of \u223c700 individuals from northern Namibia, sampled \nfrom an endogamous population called the Himba. Due to a culture of concurrent \nrelationships in the Himba, there is a high proportion of half-sibships. We \naccurately identify first through fourth-degree relationships and distinguish \nbetween various second-degree relationships: half-sibships, avuncular pairs, and \ngrandparent-grandchildren. We further validate our approach in a second \nAfrican-descent dataset, the Barbados Asthma Genetics Study (BAGS), and a \nEuropean-descent founder population from Quebec. Accurate reconstruction of \nrelatives facilitates estimation of allele frequencies, tracing allele \ntrajectories, improved phasing, heritability and other population genomic \nquestions.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Generative artificial intelligence models, such as GPT-4 and \nChatGPT, are experiencing a surge in popularity due to their enhanced \nperformance and reliability. However, the application of these models in \nspecialized domains, such as occupational medicine, remains largely unexplored.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the potential suitability of a generative \nlarge language model, such as ChatGPT, as a support tool for medical research \nand even clinical decisions in occupational medicine in Germany.\nMETHODS: In this randomized controlled study, the usability of ChatGPT for \nmedical research and clinical decision-making was investigated using a web \napplication developed for this purpose. Eligibility criteria were being a \nphysician or medical student. Participants (N=56) were asked to work on 3 cases \nof occupational lung diseases and answer case-related questions. They were \nallocated via coin weighted for proportions of physicians in each group into 2 \ngroups. One group researched the cases using an integrated chat application \nsimilar to ChatGPT based on the latest GPT-4-Turbo model, while the other used \ntheir usual research methods, such as Google, Amboss, or DocCheck. The primary \noutcome was case performance based on correct answers, while secondary outcomes \nincluded changes in specific question accuracy and self-assessed occupational \nmedicine expertise before and after case processing. Group assignment was not \ntraditionally blinded, as the chat window indicated membership; participants \nonly knew the study examined web-based research, not group specifics.\nRESULTS: Participants of the ChatGPT group (n=27) showed better performance in \nspecific research, for example, for potentially hazardous substances or \nactivities (eg, case 1: ChatGPT group 2.5 hazardous substances that cause \npleural changes versus 1.8 in a group with own research; P=.01; Cohen r=-0.38), \nand led to an increase in self-assessment with regard to specialist knowledge \n(from 3.9 to 3.4 in the ChatGPT group vs from 3.5 to 3.4 in the own research \ngroup; German school grades between 1=very good and 6=unsatisfactory; P=.047). \nHowever, clinical decisions, for example, whether an occupational disease report \nshould be filed, were more often made correctly as a result of the participant's \nown research (n=29; eg, case 1: Should an occupational disease report be filed? \nYes for 7 participants in the ChatGPT group vs 14 in their own research group; \nP=.007; odds ratio 6.00, 95% CI 1.54-23.36).\nCONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can be a useful tool for targeted medical research, even \nfor rather specific questions in occupational medicine regarding occupational \ndiseases. However, clinical decisions should currently only be supported and not \nmade by the large language model. Future systems should be critically assessed, \neven if the initial results are promising.\n\n\u00a9 Felix A Weuthen, Nelly Otte, Hanif Krabbe, Thomas Kraus, Julia Krabbe. \nOriginally published in JMIR Formative Research (https://formative.jmir.org).\n\nDOI: 10.2196/63857\nPMID: 40393042", "authors": ["Weuthen FA", "Otte N", "Krabbe H", "Kraus T", "Krabbe J"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40393042/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:36:36.843412Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40393042", "doi": "10.2196/63857", "journal": "JMIR formative research"}}

There are \ncurrently no satisfactory treatments for IBD. Administration of the probiotic \nBacillus licheniformis (Bl) can improves colitis by regulating the gut \nmicrobiota. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) treatment has favorable effects \non immunity, as well as on inflammatory diseases like colitis. We hypothesized \nthat the expression of an additional cyp gene by the Bl to increase its ABA \nproduction would enhance its effects.\nRESULTS: In this study, we found that a Bl-cyp strain overexpressing the cyp \ngene secreted more ABA into its supernatant than either the parental Bl stain or \na Bl-pET82a strain expressing only a vector pET82a when these bacteria were \ngrown in Nfb medium for 48\u00a0h. The prophylactic administration of the Bl-cyp \nstrain culture more effectively attenuated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced \ncolitis in mice compared to the Bl and Bl-pET28a strains. These findings were \nassociated with significantly reduced epithelial barrier damage, as well as \nincreased number of goblet cells and expression levels of occludin gene in the \ncolonic epithelial layer, and decreased serum LPS levels in the Bl-cyp group. In \naddition, the administration of Bl-cyp strain effectively regulated the \ndisordered gut microbiota by improving their diversity, richness and \ncompositions more than the Bl or Bl-pET82a strain, including the ratio of \nBacteroidota: Bacillota. It also inhibited the excessive growth of opportunistic \npathogen Escherichia just like the Bl or Bl-pET82a strain. Moreover, the \npreventive administration of the Bl-cyp strain to mice following DSS-induced \ncolitis enhanced the proportion of Treg cells and suppressed the proportion of \nTh17 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), decreased the levels of \npro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-22, and increased the level of \nanti-inflammatory IL-10 in colon tissues, similar to treatment with a high \nconcentration of the ABA standard (ABA-H). Notably, the treatment with the \nBl-cyp strain more effectively regulated the disordered microbiota than the \nABA-H.\nCONCLUSIONS: The administration of the Bl-cyp strain may provide a novel \npreventive approach for IBD, and may exert its effects by modulating the gut \nmicrobiota and host's immune status.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Lipid accumulation and its regulation by \nautophagy are key areas of research for understanding metabolic disorders in \nhuman and model mammals. However, the role of autophagy in lipid regulation \nremains poorly characterized in non-model fish species of importance to food \nproduction, which could be important for managing health and welfare in \naquaculture. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of autophagy \nin lipid regulation using a macrophage-like cell line (SHK-1) from Atlantic \nsalmon (Salmo salar L.), the world's most commercially valuable farmed finfish. \nMultiple lines of experimental evidence reveal that the autophagic pathway \nresponsible for lipid droplet breakdown is conserved in Atlantic salmon cells. \nWe employed global lipidomics and proteomics analyses on SHK-1 cells subjected \nto lipid overload, followed by treatment with rapamycin to induce autophagy. \nThis revealed that activating autophagy via rapamycin enhances storage of \nunsaturated triacylglycerols and suppresses key lipogenic proteins, including \nfatty acid elongase 6, fatty acid binding protein 2 and acid sphingomyelinase. \nMoreover, fatty acid elongase 6 and fatty acid binding protein 2 were identified \nas possible cargo for autophagosomes, suggesting a critical role for autophagy \nin lipid metabolism in fish. Together, this study establishes a novel model of \nlipotoxicity and advances understanding of lipid autophagy in fish cells, with \nsignificant implications for addressing fish health issues in aquaculture.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Electronic address: dajunchai-fy@fjmu.edu.cn.\n\nAIMS: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by \nlipid accumulation and inflammation. Macrophage phenotypic transformation plays \na critical role in AS progression. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been \nproved to regulate the phenotype of macrophages. This study investigates the \nrole and molecular mechanism of AhR activation by its endogenous ligand, \n2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) \nattenuates AS.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed Western blotting to analyze the expression of \nAhR, NF-\u03baB, and lipocalin-2 (LCN2). Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence \nstaining were used to assess the phenotype of macrophages. Plaque progression \nwas evaluated using pathological staining. Transcriptome sequencing was utilized \nto explore the potential mechanism by which AhR promotes macrophage phenotypic \ntransformation. CUT&Tag-qPCR and lentivirus infection confirmed that the \nAhR/NF-\u03baB/LCN2 pathway regulates macrophage polarization.\nKEY FINDINGS: Activation of AhR by ITE reduced plaque area and inhibited lipid \ndeposition. ITE significantly increased the number of M2-like macrophages both \nin vivo and in vitro. Transcriptome sequencing identified LCN2 as a key target \nfor AhR-mediated macrophage M2-like polarization. Furthermore, AhR activation \nsuppressed the NF-\u03baB/LCN2 pathway.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal that AhR promotes the macrophages to exhibit \nM2-like characteristics to attenuate AS by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB/LCN2 pathway. \nThese results suggest that AhR may serve as a novel therapeutic target for AS.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Although combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) reduces both cellular and soluble activation markers, it fails to completely control pIA despite consistent plasma viral load suppression. One of the mechanisms involved in pIA is may be an incomplete suppression of viral replication not reflected by plasma viral load, which only reflects a balance between viral replication and clearance of HIV-RNA. In addition, low-level viremia detected in most HIV-1-infected patients despite years on cART. Unintegrated 2-LTR HIV-DNA, and cellular associated HIV-RNAs, as products of active integrated DNA transcription, support this issue.\n\nFurthermore, the key rationales behind simplifying cART are a reduction of toxicities, lower risk of resistance mutations in case of virological failure and saving costs. One of these simplification strategies is a dual therapy which, based on the data up to date and in our clinical experience, has similar virological efficacy than cART. However, it is unknown if this strategy could increase the persistent HIV-1 replication and, therefore, pIA. The CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio as a marker of immune recovery, the changes in T cell immune activation, senescence, exhaustion and apoptosis, and the cellular associated HIV-DNA and -RNA would answer the question if simplification to dual therapy would provide less control of residual HIV replication and, therefore, a detriment on pIA compared to triple therapy and, therefore, would worsen the patients' long-term prognosis.", "authors": ["Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Roc\u00edo"], "publication_date": "2021-08-30T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03447873", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:37:05.465359Z", "metadata": {"nctId": "NCT03447873", "status": "COMPLETED", "studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE4"], "conditions": ["HIV Infections"], "interventions": ["Continue with triple therapy", "Switch to DTG + 3TC", "Switch to DRV/cobicistat + 3TC"]}}

{"id": "NCT00172627", "source": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "title": "Association and Mechanism Between Cyclooxygenase-2 and Interleukin-6 in Gastric Cancer", "text": "Evidence is rapidly accumulating that chronic inflammation may contribute to carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms in a number of malignancies, including gastric carcinoma (GC). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme pivotal in the inflammatory response, converts arachidonic acid to the prostaglandins (PGs) required in initiating and maintaining reactions during the inflammatory process. Over-expression of COX-2 has been reported in a wide variety of cancers and is therefore implicated to play an important role in carcinogenesis. COX-2 can be blocked by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIADs) and is currently the most studied therapeutic target of NSAIDs. Clinically, NSAIDs have long been used to treat various inflammatory or rheumatologic disorders.\n\nEarlier clinical studies have confirmed an association between COX-2 over-expression and GC occurrence. The known mechanisms by which COX-2 promotes carcinogenesis include evasion from apoptosis, suppression of immunity, promotion of angiogenesis, and facilitation of invasiveness. However, inflammation-associated factors mediating the effects of COX-2 on carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with gastritis and GC. Our earlier works has disclosed that IL-6 can promote angiogenic and anti-apoptotic ability of GC. However, the relationship between COX-2 and IL-6 in GC remains unknown.\n\nThe present study aims to investigate the clinical association between COX-2 and IL-6 in GC, to use a GC cell model for experimental study on causation and mechanism, and to verify the in vivo effect of COX-2 on IL-6 by an animal model.\n\nWe will collect 100 consecutive surgical samples of GC from the pathology archive of National Taiwan University Hospital and use immunohistochemical stain to compare protein expression in GC. The clinical study is to define certain subgroups of GC exhibiting an association between COX-2 and IL-6. In experimental study, we will clarify the causal relationship by the dose- and time-dependent experiments of COX-2 transient transfection in a GC cell line. COX-2 acts mainly via PGs, like PGE2. Therefore, we also stimulate GC cells with exogenous stimulation of PGE2 and EP receptor 1-4 agonists to determine the possible way(s) by which COX-2 induces IL-6 expression. A selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and various inhibitors of PGE2 receptors are used as well to block COX-2 for determining the signaling pathway of COX-2 on IL-6. Finally, we will establish a stable COX-2 over-expressing transfectant of GC cells and its control vector transfectant for xenograft implantation study on mice. A COX-2 selective agent, celecoxib, will be administered orally to mice and tumor blocks will be harvested for determination of IL-6 expression.\n\nThe present study will provide clearer understanding of the role of COX-2 on the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in GC in both clinical and basic aspects. It might also stand for a model capable of systemically investigating the role of COX-2 on various cytokines implicated in GC.", "authors": ["National Taiwan University Hospital"], "publication_date": "2005-09-15T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00172627", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:37:05.465359Z", "metadata": {"nctId": "NCT00172627", "status": "UNKNOWN", "studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "phases": null, "conditions": ["Gastric Cancer"], "interventions": []}}

To address these, biomimetic \nbacterial outer membrane nanoparticles (BM-NPs) are designed by integrating the \nprecise targeting capability of detoxified outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) with \nthe efficient drug-loading properties of liposomes. BM-NPs exhibit superior \ntargeting efficiency toward peripheral neutrophils and macrophages, enabling \nspatiotemporal drug delivery via immune cells. An innovative \"Tortoise and Hare\" \ndynamic adaptive delivery strategy is introduced, where neutrophils facilitate \nrapid drug transport during the acute phase of SCI, while macrophages ensure \nsustained delivery during the subacute phase. This strategy aligns with the \ndynamic pathological progression of SCI, offering precision targeting tailored \nto different stages of injury. BM-NPs demonstrate multifaceted therapeutic \neffects, including the suppression of foam cell formation through coordinated \nenhancement of lipid droplet autophagy and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, they \nmodulate the inflammatory microenvironment, preserve myelin integrity, and \nsignificantly promote neural functional recovery post-SCI.

Preoperative radiograph imaging revealed the \npresence of a thoracic kyphosis and scoliosis, with a Cobb angle of 150\u00b0 and \n130\u00b0, respectively. A two-stage strategy was devised, comprising halo-pelvic \ntraction and spinal fusion with pedicle screws. The neurological deficit showed \ngradual improvement and ultimately complete recovery during the distraction \nphase. The curve decreased to an acceptable level, and posterior pedicle screws \nwere implanted and fused without osteotomy. Postoperatively, the hunchback was \nno longer visible. There were no complications associated with halo-pelvic \ntraction. At the 3-year follow-up, the correction angle and trunk balance were \nwell maintained.\nCONCLUSION: It is possible that neurological deficit resulting from severe \nscoliosis may be reversed following the correction of the spinal curvature. The \napplication of halo-pelvic traction generates substantial corrective forces, \nfacilitating the correction of severe spinal deformities in a gradual and secure \nmanner. A two-stage treatment strategy for patients with severe kyphoscoliosis \nin neurofibromatosis type 1 may offer an alternative approach to correcting the \nsevere curve while avoiding the potential complications associated with a rapid, \none-stage correction.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aims to compare the \nefficacy and safety of thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) and local \ninfiltration (LI) anesthesia for PKP to treat thoracic OVCFs combined with IN.\nMETHODS: Patients with OVCFs combined with IN scheduled to undergo PKP between \nJanuary 2021 and June 2022 were randomized into the following groups: TPVB and \nLI. Intraoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score, patients' anesthesia \nsatisfaction (PAS) score, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were \nrecorded. Follow-up consultations were scheduled at 1\u00a0day, 1 month, 3 months, \nand 6 months postoperatively, recording the demographic characteristics, \nincluding surgical information, and complications observed in both groups. The \nclinical evaluation parameters included the VAS score, Oswestry Disability Index \n(ODI), and Short Form (SF)-36 score. Radiological evaluation parameters included \nthe anterior vertebral body height ratio (AVBHR) and Cobb's angle of the injured \nvertebra.\nRESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled (30 in each group), with similar clinical \nand demographic characteristics. The mean intraoperative VAS scores from time \npoints T1 to T5 were significantly lower in the TPVB group [2 (1-2), 3 (2-3), 3 \n(3-4), 3 (2-3), and 2 (2-2)] than in the LI group [2 (2-3), 4 (3-4), 4 (3-5), \n3.5 (3-4), and 3 (3-3)]. The PAS scores were significantly higher in the TPVB \ngroup [3(3-3)] than in the LI group [2(2-3)]. The TPVB group demonstrated \nsignificantly better clinical outcomes than that of the LI group at 1\u00a0day \npostoperatively, as evidenced by higher VAS, ODI, and SF-36\u00a0bp scores. The \ncorresponding scores in the TPVB group were 2 (2-2), 20.47\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14, and 84 \n(84-84), respectively, and in the LI group were 3 (3-3), 22.53\u2009\u00b1\u20094.20, and 84 \n(74-84), respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No statistically significant differences in \nradiological terms were observed between the two groups. No postoperative \ncomplications were observed in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to LI, TPVB provided better intraoperative and \npostoperative short-term analgesia with an equivalent safety profile when \nadministered to patients with OVCFs combined with IN.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2000035034, 28/07/2020, https//www.chictr.org.cn.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In 2021, the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) classified adult-type diffuse gliomas into three \ndistinct categories: astrocytomas (isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH]-mutated), \noligodendrogliomas (IDH-mutated and 1p/19q-deleted), and glioblastomas, \nIDH-wildtype (GBM). GBM is the most common and aggressive primary malignant \ntumor of the Central Nervous System (CNS), characterized by its high recurrence \nrate and rapid growth. Dysregulation of HOX genes is a well-established \nphenomenon in both solid and liquid malignancies, playing crucial roles in \nvarious fundamental characteristics of cancer, including GBM. In recent years, \nHOX genes have gained recognition not only as key regulators of tumor \nprogression but also as potential biomarkers for predicting disease outcomes and \nas promising therapeutic targets for GBM. This review compiles the latest \nresearch on HOX genes in GBM, encompassing studies published before and after \nthe 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors.

Two \nblood-based analytes for early detection and diagnosis of HPV + HNSCC, \ncirculating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPVDNA) and HPV early protein antibodies (HPV Ab), \nshow promise, yet current approaches lack adequate diagnostic accuracy for broad \nclinical utility. Further, performance metrics across various assays for \ndetecting these analytes alone or in combination have not been compared \nhead-to-head. To address these limitations and knowledge gaps, we developed a \nmultifeature HPV whole-genome sequencing (WGS) liquid biopsy for improved \nlow-level ctHPVDNA detection. We defined the performance characteristics of this \nWGS-based approach and compared it head-to-head with existing blood-based HPV \ndetection approaches to determine the optimal single or combinatorial biomarker \nstrategy for a future prospective study of HPV + HNSCC early detection.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested blood samples from 304 participants: 152 patients \nwith untreated incident HPV + HNSCC (77% stage I) and 152 general population \ncontrol patients. We compared WGS-based ctHPVDNA detection, single-plex Droplet \nDigital PCR (ddPCR)-based ctHPVDNA detection, multiplex ddPCR-based ctHPVDNA \ndetection, multiplex HPV Ab detection, and clinical standard-of-care tissue \nbiopsy, benchmarked to gold-standard HPV + HNSCC tissue diagnosis. We then \nmodeled the operational feasibility of these approaches as screening biomarkers \nfor HPV + HNSCC.\nRESULTS: HPV WGS sensitivity and specificity were 98.7% and 98.7%, respectively. \nSingle-plex ddPCR sensitivity and specificity were 94.2% and 98.6%, \nrespectively. Multiplex ddPCR sensitivity and specificity were 90.6% and 96.3%, \nrespectively. HPV Ab sensitivity and specificity were 86.4% and 96.3%, \nrespectively. A combinatorial approach using both HPV WGS and HPV Ab yielded a \nsensitivity and specificity of 87.4% and 98.8%, respectively. In a head-to-head \ncomparison, HPV WGS demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic accuracy \ncompared with ddPCR (Youden index for HPV WGS, 0.99 vs. ddPCR, 0.90; P < 0.001), \nHPV Ab (HPV WGS, 0.99 vs. HPV Ab, 0.83; P < 0.001), and clinical workup (HPV \nWGS, 0.99 vs. clinical workup, 0.82; P < 0.001), which was maintained when \nevaluating only early-stage disease cases. For men ages 55 to 74, HPV WGS \nyielded the lowest number needed to screen (2,903 men) and the highest positive \npredictive value (2.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: HPV WGS-based ctHPVDNA detection demonstrated the highest \nsensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy and thus the lowest number \nneeded to screen and highest positive predictive value compared with ddPCR-based \nctHPVDNA detection, HPV Ab-based detection, and combinatorial approaches. These \nresults highlight the promise of HPV WGS liquid biopsy for screening and early \ndetection of HPV + HNSCC and the need for modeling and cost-effectiveness \nstudies to evaluate and guide screening implementation.\n\n\u00a92025 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-2525\nPMID: 40392113", "authors": ["Bryan ME", "Aye L", "Das D", "Hirayama S", "Al-Inaya Y", "Mendel J", "Naegele S", "Efthymiou V", "Alzumaili B", "Faquin WC", "Sadow PM", "Lin D", "Varvares MA", "Feng AL", "Deschler DG", "Chan AW", "Paly J", "Park JC", "Roberts T", "Merkin R", "Mishra SK", "Kr\u00f6ller L", "Michels B", "Iafrate AJ", "Wirth LJ", "Adalsteinsson VA", "Crowson M", "Waterboer T", "Mirabello L", "Lawrence MS", "Guan Z", "Fisch AS", "Richmon JD", "Faden DL"], "publication_date": "2025 May 20", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392113/", "retrieved_at": "2025-05-21T03:37:40.208626Z", "metadata": {"pmid": "40392113", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-2525", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"}}

Unlike traditional Raman \nspectroscopy, which relies on weak scattering signals, SERS amplifies Raman \nsignals using plasmonic nanoparticles, enabling highly sensitive molecular \ndetection. This technological advancement has led to the development of SERS \nnanotags with remarkable multiplexing capabilities for biosensing applications. \nRecent progress has expanded the use of SERS nanotags in bioimaging, \ntheranostics, and more recently, liquid biopsy. The distinction between SERS and \nconventional Raman spectroscopy is highlighted, followed by an exploration of \nthe molecular assembly of SERS nanotags. Significant progress in bioimaging is \nsummarized, including in\u00a0vitro studies on 2D/3D cell cultures, ex\u00a0vivo tissue \nimaging, in\u00a0vivo diagnostics, spectroscopic-guided surgery for tumor margin \ndelineation, and liquid biopsy tools for detecting cancer and SARS-CoV-2.

The effects of \nHJD on 5-Fu sensitivity in BGC-823 cells were evaluated with \n3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, reverse \ntranscription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western \nblotting. Synergistic effects in vector-transfected and miRNA-21-3p knockdown \ncells were assessed by colony formation, wound healing, transwell assays, and \nflow cytometry (FCM). An in vivo study evaluated the impact of HJD on 5-Fu \nsensitivity, measuring miRNA-21-3p, tumor protein p53 (p53), N-cadherin, \nvimentin, and E-cadherin in tumors, along with tumor volume and weight.\nRESULTS: miRNA-21-3p and p53 were key targets in HJD's therapeutic effect on GC. \nRT-qPCR showed that HJD combined with 5-Fu reduced miRNA-21-3p and upregulated \np53 in vector cells and increased p53 mRNA (p < 0.01) and protein (p < 0.05) \ncompared to 5-Fu alone.

{"id": "NCT01285531", "source": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "title": "Pediatric Lumbar Puncture Success Using the COMPASS", "text": "Objective: To evaluate pediatric emergency department provider lumbar puncture success with and without the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced, a new pressure transducer, in order to determine: the proportion of lumbar punctures where a) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on the first attempt, b) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on any attempt, and c) sufficient cerebrospinal fluid is obtained for standard tests (culture, chemistries, cell count); the time to provider success in obtaining a) a drop of fluid from the needle, and b) opening pressure measurement; the proportion of successful lumbar punctures that contain blood; and provider satisfaction.\n\nBackground: Lumbar punctures are necessary to diagnose meningitis, neurological diseases and some cancers. They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during lumbar punctures is recommended but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column manometry is cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure transduction probes that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or recommended for lumbar punctures. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during the LP procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure changes during LPs. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive, disposable, medical device, specifically designed for use during LPs, that has the potential to increase lumbar punctures success and decrease blood contamination. It attaches to the spinal needle and displays both a numeric pressure value and a pressure waveform, allowing physicians to more readily identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device is small, easy to use, and readily incorporated into standard practice.\n\nThe Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback about pressure that may allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the CSF space, and instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the space is reached. The investigators believe the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar punctures success and decrease the proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become the standard of care and be used in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected to demonstrate the clinical utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical community.
