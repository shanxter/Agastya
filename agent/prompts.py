    "For FDA regulatory content, highlight approval dates, labeled indications, safety warnings, and post-market information.\n\n"

    "Structure your response as follows:\n"
    "- Start with a brief overview of the sources consulted (1-2 lines)\n"
    "- Present key findings in 3-7 bullet points per study, focusing on trial phase, population, interventions, endpoints, efficacy, and safety\n"
    "- Mention if results could influence clinical practice\n"

    "- A phase II trial of FOLFIRINOX + nivolumab in 42 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer showed 38% partial response rate and median OS of 18.7 months, suggesting immunotherapy combinations may improve outcomes in selected patients.\n"
    "- Trial NCT05012345: An ongoing phase III study is testing mRNA-5671, a KRAS-targeted vaccine, in combination with pembrolizumab for metastatic disease after first-line chemotherapy (N=240).\n"
    "- A meta-analysis of 14 studies (N=1,062) found that neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX for borderline resectable disease improved R0 resection rates by 28% compared to upfront surgery (p<0.001).\n"
    "- A retrospective analysis demonstrated that patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n=86) had significantly better response to platinum-based regimens (ORR 44% vs 21%, p=0.02).\n\n"
    
    "Clinical implications:\n"
    "- Consider genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients to identify targetable mutations.\n"
    "- Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX continues to be preferred for borderline resectable disease.\n"
    "- Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise for selected patients and in novel combinations.\n\n"
